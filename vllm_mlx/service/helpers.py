    reasoning identically — bypassing this on one route was the
    silent-divergence bug filed as issue #413.

    Rule (drives the unclosed-`<tool_call>` leak fix in PR #208): when
    the tool parser successfully extracted ``tool_calls`` its
    ``cleaned_text`` is authoritative — both ``<think>`` and tool tags
    are already stripped. Run the reasoning parser on the raw output
    only to recover ``reasoning_text``, never to overwrite
    ``cleaned_text`` (that path would re-introduce the tool tags the
    parser stripped, since the reasoning parser only knows about
    ``<think>``).

    When no tool_calls fire, the reasoning parser is the only thing
    that can pull ``<think>`` out — run it on cleaned_text (or raw
    output if cleaning produced an empty string). If the parser
    returns ``(None, None)`` it means the input has no reasoning
    markers it understands — keep the original ``cleaned_text``
    instead of clobbering it with ``None``. This is critical for
    harmony models, where ``clean_output_text`` (called in
    ``engine.generate``) has already extracted the final-channel
    content and stripped channel markup before the parser ever sees
    the text: a ``HarmonyReasoningParser`` searching for
    ``<|channel|>final`` on the already-cleaned string returns
    ``(None, None)`` and without this guard would silently turn a
    fully-formed answer into an empty ``TextBlock`` for clients

    """Issue #569: never silently drop an assistant turn.

    The route layer's normal ``content`` extraction can legitimately
    produce an empty ``final_content`` when the model emits ONLY
    reasoning tokens and never closes the reasoning channel into a
    ``content``/``final`` channel or a tool call. The exact production
    failure mode: ``gemma-4-26b-4bit`` multi-turn tool flows where the
    model gets stuck inside ``<|channel>thought\\n...`` and runs out of
    its token budget before emitting any ``<|tool_call>`` or
    ``<|channel>content`` marker. The engine's token-level
    ``OutputRouter`` correctly routes every token to ``reasoning`` —
    but the route then emits an OpenAI-compat message with
    ``content=null`` and ``tool_calls=null`` while
    ``reasoning_content`` carries the entire stuck thought. Agentic
    clients (Cline, Cursor, Codex CLI) read ``content`` and
    ``tool_calls`` only, see an empty message, and either retry into
    the same trap or stall.

    Rescue rule: when ``final_content`` is empty/None AND no
    ``tool_calls`` fired AND ``reasoning_text`` is non-empty, surface
    ``reasoning_text`` as ``content``. ``reasoning_content`` stays
    populated unchanged — duplication between the two fields is the
    lesser evil vs. a silently empty response.

    Cases that fall through unchanged:

    * Happy path: ``final_content`` is non-empty AND has at least one
      non-whitespace char → return as-is. Whitespace-only
      ``final_content`` (``"   \n"``) is treated as semantically
      absent for rescue purposes (codex round-3 NIT on #676): an
      OpenAI-compat client still sees an empty assistant turn, so
      the rescue must be allowed to fire when reasoning is present.
      The strip is on the predicate only — the original
      ``final_content`` propagates back on the happy path so callers
      that DO want the whitespace preserved still see it as-is.
    * Tool-call path: ``tool_calls`` non-empty → the spec already
      requires ``content`` to be ``None`` (the tool call IS the
      response); rescue does NOT fire.
    * Truly empty: ``reasoning_text`` empty OR whitespace-only →
      nothing semantically rescue-worthy; ``None`` propagates. The
      whitespace-only check (codex round-1 NIT on #676) closes a
      gap where ``"   \n"`` would surface as non-empty ``content``
      while still being semantically empty to clients. The
      ORIGINAL ``reasoning_text`` is returned untouched (no
      ``.strip()`` on the assignment) so callers that DO want the
      whitespace preserved still see it as-is — the strip is on
      the predicate only.

    The rescue lives at the route layer (not the engine) because the
    engine's ``_route_tokens_for_channels`` has a tested contract
    (issue #442's harmony fix pins ``content == ""`` when only the
    analysis channel fires) — flipping that at the engine level
    would re-leak analysis text into ``content`` for the original
    #442 case. The rescue runs AFTER tool-call parsing and AFTER the
    reasoning/content split, as a final route-level safety net so
    silent drops never escape to clients regardless of which model
    family produced them.

    Codex round-3 BLOCKING on #676: this helper is now the SINGLE
    predicate for both the non-streaming AND streaming rescue paths
    (chat.py:~1285 and chat.py:~1605). The streaming path used to
    promote ``processor.accumulated_reasoning`` directly into
    ``delta.content`` without the whitespace guard, so a
    reasoning-only stream of ``"   \n"`` would emit a semantically
    empty ``delta.content`` while non-streaming correctly suppressed
    it. Routing both call sites through this helper closes that
    asymmetry — the predicate cannot drift between the two paths
    because there's only one of it.

# Reasoning-cutoff sentinel (default ON; opt out via
# RAPID_MLX_REASONING_CUTOFF_NOTICE=disabled). H-01 / R-01 / issue #858.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When a reasoning model (qwen3, deepseek_r1, phi-4-mini-reasoning, glm4,
# gemma4, vibethinker, …) is called with a low ``max_tokens`` budget and
# generation is cut short BEFORE ``</think>`` (or the harmony final-channel
# marker), the parser-wide rule pinned by D-STOP-THINK + D-HARMONY-LEAK is
# "route everything to ``reasoning_content`` and leave ``content``
# null/empty" — the in-progress thought trace is NOT the final answer, so
# promoting it to ``content`` would ship byte-identical bytes in both
# fields (the leak shape those PRs explicitly closed).
#
# History:
#
# * H-01 (PR #802, 2026-06-21, v0.8.3): introduced an opt-OUT sentinel
#   that was injected into ``content`` by default to give SDK consumers
#   a literal "truncated, raise max_tokens" cue instead of an empty
#   bubble.
# * R-01 (PR #815, v0.8.5): flipped the default to opt-IN on
#   structured-purity rationale (every transport already carries an
#   unambiguous ``finish_reason="length"`` / ``status="incomplete"`` /
#   ``stop_reason="max_tokens"``, so synthesizing a literal text block
#   the model never produced was deemed harmful injection).
# * Issue #858 (this commit, v0.8.12): reverts R-01. Every GUI client
#   (rapid-desktop, vanilla OpenAI SDK consumers, OpenWebUI compat
#   layers) renders only ``message.content`` and ignores the structured
#   ``finish_reason`` field — under R-01's default-off, they showed an
#   empty bubble whenever a reasoning model hit ``max_tokens`` mid-think.
#   The literal sentinel is the user-visible cue that ``max_tokens`` was
#   too low, and restoring it as the default outweighs the
#   structured-purity gain. Power callers that want strict-null behaviour
#   set ``RAPID_MLX_REASONING_CUTOFF_NOTICE=disabled`` (or ``0`` /
#   ``false`` / ``no`` / ``off``).
#
# Structured truncation signals — also present on every transport,
# regardless of the env var setting — for callers that DO want to gate
# on them:
#
#   * /v1/chat/completions  → ``finish_reason="length"``
#   * /v1/responses         → ``status="incomplete"`` +
#                              ``output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens``
#   * /v1/messages          → ``stop_reason="max_tokens"`` +
#                              ``thinking`` content block
#
# Scope (unchanged across the R-01 ↔ issue #858 flip):
#
# * Fires ONLY when the env var has NOT been set to a disable value.
# * Fires ONLY on ``finish_reason="length"`` (NOT on ``"stop"`` —
#   stop-string mid-think is D-STOP-THINK's exact case, where the strict
#   null contract must hold and the caller can re-request to drive the
#   model past the stop string).
# * Fires ONLY when ``content`` is empty/None AND ``reasoning_text`` is
#   non-empty — the silent-drop shape clients actually trip on. Happy-
#   path (closed ``</think>answer`` split) flows untouched.
# * Fires ONLY when no ``tool_calls`` were extracted — tool-only responses
#   legitimately ship ``content=None`` per the OpenAI spec.
#
# Single source of truth — both the OpenAI ``/v1/chat/completions``
# non-stream + stream paths AND the Anthropic ``/v1/messages`` adapter
# AND the ``/v1/responses`` adapter call this helper, so the user-visible
# behaviour cannot drift between surfaces. (The streaming path emits the
# sentinel as one final-chunk ``delta.content`` event, not per-token, so
# no token-by-token leak of the sentinel string itself.)


#: ``RESCUE_TAIL_LENGTH`` is re-exported above from
#: :mod:`vllm_mlx.api.constants` — kept at module scope so existing
#: callers (route helpers + tests) continue to import it from

#: #860) is still honoured as a back-compat alias so existing

#:
#: GUI clients (rapid-desktop ChatView, OpenAI-SDK consumers, etc.)
#: render blank message bubbles when ``content`` is ``None`` even
#: though ``finish_reason="length"`` is set — the rescue string is the
#: user-facing signal that ``max_tokens`` was too low PLUS a glimpse of
#: the truncated thought trace. Power callers that prefer the strict-
#: null shape can opt out with any of the listed spellings on either
#: env var.

    gate per-request via ``monkeypatch.setenv`` without restarting the
    process. The cost is negligible (``os.environ.get`` is a dict
    lookup) and matches how every other ``RAPID_MLX_*`` env-gated knob
    is read in this module.

    Two env vars are honoured (in this priority order):

    * ``RAPID_MLX_REASONING_RESCUE`` — R12-8 primary name. Easier to
      discover than the legacy alias (``RESCUE`` is what the operator
      thinks of it as) and aligns with the task spec.
    * ``RAPID_MLX_REASONING_CUTOFF_NOTICE`` — legacy alias from PR
      #802 / #860 (issue #858). Still honoured so existing
      rapid-desktop deployments and operator runbooks that already
      reference this name keep working without a rebuild.

    The rescue is DISABLED when EITHER env var is set to a disable
    spelling (``"0"`` / ``"false"`` / ``"no"`` / ``"off"`` /
    ``"disabled"``, case-insensitive, whitespace-stripped). Operator
    intent: "I do not want the rescue", regardless of which name was
    used. Anything else — including unset, the empty string,
    ``"1"`` / ``"true"`` / ``"on"`` / ``"yes"`` / ``"enabled"``, or
    any arbitrary unrecognised value — leaves the rescue enabled.

    Layout: ``"<sentinel>\\n\\n<tail-of-reasoning>"``. The sentinel
    anchors the opening (agentic auto-retry clients pattern-match the
    prefix), then a blank line, then the LAST ``RESCUE_TAIL_LENGTH``
    chars of the reasoning trace so a human sees the partial
    conclusion. The tail is taken from the END of ``reasoning_text``
    because that's where the partial answer lives in every reasoning
    parser dialect we ship (qwen3, deepseek_r1, glm4, vibethinker,
    harmony — all build the answer at the tail of the thought).

    Trailing whitespace on the reasoning trace is stripped before the
    slice so the rescue doesn't end on a partial newline. The caller
    has already verified ``reasoning_text`` is non-empty + non-
    whitespace (see ``_apply_reasoning_cutoff_notice``), so an empty
    tail is impossible by construction.

    The reasoning trace is stripped of channel markup BEFORE the
    tail slice is chosen, then the slice runs through
    :func:`sanitize_output` (general special-token catch-all:
    ``<|...|>``, harmony channel markers, ``</tool_call>``, etc.).
    The strip-before-slice order matters: a naive slice of the raw
    reasoning bytes can bisect a structural ``<think>`` /
    ``</think>`` tag (codex r3 P2: when reasoning is just slightly
    longer than ``RESCUE_TAIL_LENGTH`` and starts with ``<think>``,
    the raw slice begins ``hink>...`` and the regex stripper no
    longer matches the orphaned fragment — so the literal ``ink>``
    bytes leak into ``content``). Stripping channel markup first
    means the slice operates on the clean, in-channel byte stream
    and can never bisect a tag because there are no tags left to
    bisect.
    ``reasoning_content`` keeps the full original trace addressable
    for clients that walk both fields. Codex r1 (R12-8): the rescue
    path previously bypassed the sanitizer that ``content``
    consumers rely on. R12-M1b (Mira r12 R-3 bonus regression):
    also strip the ``<think>`` OPENER — at ``max_tokens=1`` the
    reasoning trace IS the literal opener, and ``sanitize_output``
    deliberately leaves the opener alone on the ``content`` channel
    (where it can be legit Nemotron prefix injection or literal-tag
    prose). The rescue tail is from the reasoning channel, so the
    channel-aware strip applies.

    """R12-8 / H-01: rescue ``content`` when generation was cut short
    mid-think and the strict rescue path left it empty.

    Runs AFTER ``_rescue_silent_drop_from_reasoning`` — its job is the
    UX rescue for the cases the silent-drop rescue deliberately
    SUPPRESSED (truncated ``<think>``, harmony analysis-without-final,
    Case-4 no-tag fallback). All those cases share the same observable
    shape: ``finish_reason="length"`` + empty content + non-empty
    reasoning + no tool calls.

    R12-8 (issue #259, 8-round D-carry) extends PR #802 / #860: the
    rescue is now ``sentinel + tail-of-reasoning`` rather than the bare
    sentinel, because six independent reviewers kept reopening the H-01
    carry — the bare sentinel still felt like "the model didn't
    answer". The tail is the LAST ``RESCUE_TAIL_LENGTH`` chars of the
    reasoning trace — that gives a human reader a glimpse of the
    partial conclusion without dumping the whole trace into
    ``content`` (which would re-introduce the D-STOP-THINK /
    D-HARMONY-LEAK byte-identical leak shape the rescue is allowed to
    exist alongside). ``reasoning_content`` is NEVER touched — the
    full original trace stays addressable to clients that walk both
    fields.

    Returns ``final_content`` unchanged when:
    * the env var disables the rescue (``RAPID_MLX_REASONING_RESCUE=off``
      or the legacy ``RAPID_MLX_REASONING_CUTOFF_NOTICE=disabled``)
    * ``finish_reason`` is anything other than ``"length"`` (stop-string
      cut mid-think hits the D-STOP-THINK regression guard — strict
      null wins; a clean ``"stop"`` finish on an empty answer is a
      legitimate model decision and gets no "raise max_tokens" hint)
    * ``final_content`` already carries a non-whitespace payload
    * ``tool_calls`` were extracted (OpenAI-spec ``content=None`` path)
    * ``reasoning_text`` is empty / whitespace (nothing to signal — the
      model produced nothing semantically, which is a different bug
      class and shouldn't get a "raise max_tokens" hint)

    Otherwise returns the rescue payload produced by
    :func:`_build_reasoning_rescue_payload` — the canonical shape is
    ``sentinel + "\\n\\n" + sanitized_tail``. The builder applies
    operations in this order (codex r3 P2 strip-before-slice):

    1. :func:`strip_reasoning_channel_markup` on
       ``reasoning_text.rstrip()`` — strips ``<think>`` / ``</think>``
       on the FULL trace so the next slice operates on a clean,
       in-channel byte stream. Doing it before the slice means a tag
       straddling the ``L - RESCUE_TAIL_LENGTH`` boundary can never
       leave an orphan ``<th`` / ``ink>`` fragment in the tail.
    2. ``[-RESCUE_TAIL_LENGTH:]`` slice on the stripped trace.
    3. :func:`sanitize_output` on the slice — general special-token
       catch-all (``<|...|>``, harmony markers, ``</tool_call>``, …).

    When sanitization collapses the tail to empty (e.g.
    ``reasoning_text="<think>"`` at ``max_tokens=1``), the rescue
    builder returns the bare sentinel — clients still see the
    structural truncation signal without a stray markup byte in
    ``content``. The caller writes the returned string into
    ``message.content`` (non-stream) or the final SSE ``delta.content``
    chunk (stream).

    json_schema auto-disable pattern (PR #877) — same root cause, same
    shape, single source of truth so chat / responses / anthropic /
    future surfaces share one contract.

    Trigger (all must hold):
      * ``request.tools`` is non-empty (caller wants the model to
        emit a tool_call).
      * ``request.tool_choice`` is NOT the string ``"none"``. The
        OpenAI ``tool_choice="none"`` contract explicitly tells the
        model to ignore the supplied tool list and answer in prose
        — auto-disabling thinking there would turn a prose request
        into thinking-off behavior solely because tool DEFINITIONS
        were attached, contradicting the contract (codex r1 BLOCKING).
      * Neither ``chat_template_kwargs["enable_thinking"]`` nor the
        top-level ``enable_thinking`` field is set on the request.

    Effect: merge ``{"enable_thinking": False}`` onto
    ``request.chat_template_kwargs`` so every downstream consult
    (``_resolve_enable_thinking``, ``_effective_enable_thinking``,
    ``engine.chat`` / ``stream_chat`` / ``generate_with_schema``)
    sees the resolved choice. The merge is non-destructive: any
    forward-compat keys the client passed survive untouched.

    Rationale (operator dogfood on Qwen3-0.6B-bf16, 0.8.16):
    thinking-on by default is the right answer for prose, but for
    tool-calling the model spends its entire ``max_tokens`` budget
    inside ``<think>...</think>`` before emitting the
    ``<tool_call>`` envelope. With the typical agent-SDK budget
    (``max_tokens=50..100``) the request finishes with
    ``finish_reason="length"`` and ``tool_calls=None`` — the tool
    never fires. Default-off thinking restores the "tool calling
    just works" contract; clients who explicitly opt back in
    (``chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking": true}`` or top-
    level ``enable_thinking: true``) keep the chain-of-thought and
    accept the budget risk.

    if it was skipped (no tools, or client preference already

        agent built against the OpenAI spec that passed
        ``reasoning_effort="none"`` for concise answers previously got
        reasoning anyway, blew ``max_tokens`` mid-think, and had
        ``REASONING_CUTOFF_SENTINEL`` injected into ``content`` — corrupting
        the field it re-feeds verbatim into the next turn. Suppressing the
        reasoning at the source means the truncation scenario never arises.

        ``('xhigh', 'medium', 'low')``) → merge the nearest native level into

        the request (``low`` → "keep your thinking brief", ``high`` →
        ``xhigh``). No token cap is layered on top: before #3043 a
        ``low`` request rendered the template's ``xhigh`` instruction and
        was then force-closed at 512 thinking tokens — the instruction and
        the budget contradicted each other. ``chat_template`` is the served
        template (see :func:`served_chat_template`); pass ``None`` and this
        branch is skipped.
      * graded ``reasoning_effort`` on any other template → set
        ``request.reasoning_max_tokens`` to the matching tier from
        ``OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT_TO_MAX_TOKENS`` (a subtractive cap on how
        long the model may think before answering).

    Precedence — for each path the client's explicit, more-specific native
    knob on the SAME dimension wins (mirrors
    ``maybe_auto_disable_thinking_for_tools``):

      * ``none`` controls the on/off dimension, so it yields to an explicit
        ``enable_thinking`` preference (top-level field or
        ``chat_template_kwargs``) — ``enable_thinking=true`` alongside
        ``reasoning_effort="none"`` is contradictory and the native field
        wins. A ``reasoning_max_tokens`` cap is orthogonal to ``none``:
        thinking-off makes the cap moot, so ``none`` still applies (it does
        NOT yield to a cap).
      * the native-level path controls the prompt dimension, so it yields
        to an explicit ``chat_template_kwargs.reasoning_effort`` and does
        not touch ``enable_thinking`` or ``reasoning_max_tokens``.
      * the graded cap path controls the budget dimension, so it yields to
        an explicit ``reasoning_max_tokens`` cap and does not touch
        ``enable_thinking``.

        only server-side signal that the active model is in fact
        thinking-capable — when no parser is registered the model
        does not emit ``<think>`` at all, so the budget-burn failure
        mode does not apply and the auto-disable would be inert
        (worst case: a silent template flip on a no-op flag).
      * The client did NOT pin ``enable_thinking`` via either
        ``chat_template_kwargs["enable_thinking"]`` or the top-level
        ``enable_thinking`` field (i.e.
        ``_extract_thinking_from_request`` is ``None``).
      * The client did NOT signal explicit reasoning intent through
        any of:
          - ``reasoning_max_tokens`` (chat / responses): an explicit
            per-request cap is itself proof the caller wants
            reasoning ON (just bounded). Default-disabling here
            would silently collapse the contract to "no reasoning".
          - ``reasoning_effort`` (chat / responses top-level): the
            OpenAI-spec knob that says "yes, I want reasoning at
            level X". Same rationale.
          - ``reasoning`` dict (responses native shape, e.g.
            ``{"effort":"low"}``): the canonical /v1/responses
            opt-in. Consulted via ``extra_signals`` because the
            ResponsesRequest adapter does NOT forward the field
            onto the materialized ``ChatCompletionRequest`` (the
            engine reads the already-translated
            ``reasoning_max_tokens`` / ``reasoning_effort`` fields)
            AND the ChatCompletionRequest schema sets
            ``extra="forbid"``-equivalent semantics so a stray
            ``setattr`` would 500. Pass the original
            ``ResponsesRequest`` as ``extra_signals`` to thread the
            signal in cleanly.

    ``extra_signals``: an optional secondary request-shaped object
    consulted for the SAME signal set. Used by the /v1/responses
    route to thread the Responses-native ``reasoning`` dict (and
    ``reasoning_effort`` / ``reasoning_max_tokens`` shorthands that
    live on the ``ResponsesRequest`` only) through to the helper
    without having to fork the trigger logic. The chat surface
    passes ``None`` because the materialized ``ChatCompletionRequest``
    already carries every signal it needs.

    Tools / strict-json interactions: the R12-T1F (tools) and R12-M2
    (strict json_schema) helpers run BEFORE this one in the route
    plumbing and inject ``chat_template_kwargs["enable_thinking"]=False``
    onto the request when their own triggers fire. By the time this
    helper runs ``_extract_thinking_from_request`` is no longer
    ``None`` for those paths and the gate above short-circuits to
    ``False`` — so the auto-disable family composes without double-
    firing or special-casing. Mirror of the M-2 + T1F merge contract:
    explicit signals from any of the three families win.

    Effect: merge ``{"enable_thinking": False}`` onto
    ``request.chat_template_kwargs`` so every downstream consult
    (``_resolve_enable_thinking``, ``_effective_enable_thinking``,
    ``engine.chat`` / ``stream_chat``) sees the resolved choice.
    Non-destructive merge: forward-compat keys the client passed
    survive (codex round-3 BLOCKING contract from M-2).

    Rationale (operator dogfood 0.8.16 brand-new-user simulation):
    a first-time SDK user writes::

        client.chat.completions.create(
            model="qwen3.5-4b-4bit",   # thinking-capable
            messages=[{"role":"user","content":"In 8 words, what is rapid-mlx?"}],
            max_tokens=80,
        )

    Pre-fix the model burns the entire 80-token budget inside
    ``<think>...</think>`` and never emits an answer — the response
    surfaces with ``finish_reason="length"`` and ``content`` carrying
    the rescue-sentinel header followed by raw chain-of-thought (the
    repro pinned in this task). The ``rapid-mlx chat`` REPL already
    solves this by defaulting ``--no-think`` for thinking-capable
    models — this helper is the OpenAI-SDK-surface parity for that
    same default, so a brand-new user gets a useful first request
    without having to learn ``chat_template_kwargs``.

    Returns ``True`` if the auto-disable injection fired, ``False``
    if it was skipped (no thinking parser, client pinned thinking,
    or client signalled reasoning intent). The returned bool is the
    load-bearing signal for the route's structured log line.

    carrying codepoint U+D800. That codepoint is RESERVED for the

    schema-violating payload as a normal success. This matches the
    OpenAI contract: when a ``tool_calls[i]`` is present, its arguments
    are expected to satisfy the declared parameter schema.

    Enforced today (intentionally narrow, see ``validate_param_value``):
    required object properties, ``type``, ``enum``,
    ``minimum``/``maximum``, ``minLength``/``maxLength``.
    Deferred (TODO(F-141-followup)): ``pattern``, ``format``,
    ``multipleOf``, ``uniqueItems``. Non-JSON ``arguments`` and non-dict
    parsed args remain warn-only by default; callers using
    ``enforce_required=True`` reject those shapes before agent execution.

    H-05 scope refactor: the iteration is strictly **per emitted call**.
    For each ``tc`` we look up the tool spec by its ``function.name``
    and validate the call's arguments against THAT spec's properties
    only. Tool specs the model did not call are never consulted — this
    makes "validate the called tool, not every declared tool" a
    structural invariant of the function instead of an emergent
    property of a keyed-schemas dict (which was functionally correct,
    just less self-evident: a future change to ``_extract_param_schemas``
    keying could silently re-introduce the cross-tool leak). A model
    emitting a call to a function not in ``tools`` is treated as
    schema-unknown (no constraint), mirroring the previous keyed-lookup
    behaviour.

def _resolve_sync_scheduler_for_abort(engine):
    """C-01 codex r1 BLOCKING #2 helper: find the SYNC scheduler-side
    ``abort_request`` entry point for the **currently active**
    backend.

    The codex reviewer pointed out that ``engine.abort_request`` may
    be a coroutine (``BatchedEngine.abort_request`` when the LLM path
    is loaded, because ``AsyncEngineCore.abort_request`` is async).
    Fire-and-forget via ``asyncio.ensure_future`` doesn't actually
    free the GPU on the next ``step()`` — the coroutine has to run
    to reach ``scheduler.abort_request`` (which IS sync). So we walk
    the engine's backend graph to find that sync entry point
    directly.

    codex r2 BLOCKING #1: the walk MUST respect the engine's active
    path. ``BatchedEngine`` declares BOTH ``_engine`` (AsyncEngineCore
    for the text path) AND ``_mllm_scheduler`` (MLLM path) as
    instance attributes. They start at ``None`` and get populated by
    ``start()`` based on the model's modality — but only ONE is the
    active backend the live ``request_id`` was admitted into. Calling
    ``_mllm_scheduler.abort_request(rid)`` on a request that lives in
    ``_engine.scheduler`` would enqueue the abort into the wrong
    pending set and leave the real request running. The
    ``_is_mllm`` flag is the canonical active-path signal — same
    predicate ``stream_generate`` uses to pick which backend to call
    in the first place.

    Resolution order:

      * ``engine.scheduler``                          — plain engines
                                                       exposing the
                                                       scheduler
                                                       directly (eg.
                                                       AsyncEngineCore
                                                       passed in
                                                       unwrapped).
      * MLLM-active: ``engine._mllm_scheduler``       — only when
                                                       ``engine._is_mllm``
                                                       is True.
      * text-active: ``engine._engine.scheduler``     — only when
                                                       ``engine._is_mllm``

                                                       absent).

    Returns the first callable found, or ``None`` when none of the
    paths resolve (caller falls back to the public async
    ``engine.abort_request`` as a last resort with documented
    fire-and-forget semantics).

    """M-01: walk the engine backend graph and return the bound
    ``record_disconnect_abort`` method of the active-path scheduler.

    Codex r2 NIT: returns the BOUND METHOD, not the scheduler object,
    so the call site stays one expression
    (``recorder(rid)``) without having to know which attribute name
    to look up. The name is honest about that — earlier draft was
    ``_resolve_scheduler_for_cancel_attribution`` which suggested a
    scheduler object would be returned.

    The cancel-attribution sub-counter lives on the same scheduler
    where the public-API total counter lives, so the resolver must
    follow the active-path gate (``_is_mllm``). We deliberately keep
    this separate from ``_resolve_sync_scheduler_for_abort`` (which
    gates on ``not iscoroutinefunction(abort_request)``) because the
    sub-counter is a sync-only method wholly independent of the abort
    path — re-using the abort resolver would skip schedulers that
    expose a fine sync ``record_disconnect_abort`` but happen to have
    an async ``abort_request`` shim.

    Production text path walks one extra level versus the abort
    resolver: ``BatchedEngine._engine`` is ``AsyncEngineCore`` (which
    does NOT expose ``.scheduler`` directly) and the actual
    ``Scheduler`` lives at ``BatchedEngine._engine.engine.scheduler``
    (``AsyncEngineCore`` wraps ``EngineCore`` via ``self.engine``).
    The abort resolver doesn't dig that deep because
    ``AsyncEngineCore`` has its own async ``abort_request`` shim and
    falls through to the public-async fallback — but the
    attribution counter must NOT fall back because the sub-counter
    only lives on ``Scheduler``. Without this extra hop the
    via_disconnect series would stay flat through every real
    production disconnect (Mei + Yana surfaced the cancel-rate
    counter; the operator would still have no way to see whether
    the bulk of cancels came from disconnect vs. timeout vs.
    explicit /cancel).

    Returns ``None`` if no scheduler in the active backend exposes
    the method, in which case the helper-layer caller silently
    no-ops (older schedulers without M-01 simply don't surface the
    sub-counter, the total counter on the route side still defaults
    to zero).

    streaming response finishes (or the client disconnects, or the
    generator raises). The release is the safety net for the
    streaming path; non-streaming routes mirror it via
    ``_wait_with_disconnect``.

    SSE keepalive (F-070): when ``keepalive_seconds > 0`` (default
    falls through to ``ServerConfig.sse_keepalive_seconds``), emit a
    heartbeat frame whenever the upstream generator stalls for that
    many seconds without producing a chunk. The default frame is an
    SSE comment line (``: keepalive\\n\\n``): comments start with ``:``
    per the WHATWG spec, are dropped by every conforming consumer
    (``EventSource``, OpenAI SDK), and serve as TCP-level heartbeats
    that prevent intermediate proxies (nginx ``proxy_read_timeout=60``,
    Cloudflare 100 s, EventSource ~45 s) from tearing down the
    connection during long prefills. Routes whose clients only count
    parsed SSE events may pass ``keepalive_factory`` to emit a
    route-specific heartbeat event instead. Set ``keepalive_seconds=0``
    or ``RAPID_MLX_SSE_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS=0`` to disable.

    C-01 force-abort (Astrid r3 dogfooding): when
    ``request_id_holder`` is a mutable list AND the engine publishes
    the admitted scheduler ``request_id`` into ``holder[0]``, the
    guard force-calls ``engine.scheduler.abort_request(holder[0])`` (or
    ``engine.abort_request(holder[0])`` as a thread-safe alternative)
    the moment a client disconnect is detected. Pre-C-01 the abort
    relied entirely on the generator-close cascade
    (``generator.aclose()`` in the ``finally`` → ``GeneratorExit``
    propagates upstream → ``stream_generate.finally`` calls
    ``scheduler.abort_request``). That cascade still runs as a
    belt-and-suspenders, but the EXPLICIT abort here closes Astrid's
    failure mode where a runaway no-EOS generation kept consuming GPU
    for >35 s after the client TCP-RST'd because nothing on the path
    actually reached into the scheduler with an abort signal until
    the generation hit its token cap. ``holder=None`` (default)
    preserves the pre-C-01 contract for callers that do not expose a local
    scheduler request id.

# ─── Context-length pre-check (DoS defense, rapid-desktop#273 / #463) ──
#
# A 8 MiB body of plain ASCII is still ~2M tokens — well past any model's
# context window. The body-size middleware ``vllm_mlx/middleware/body_size.py``
# stops the worst of the DoS, but a request that fits inside the byte
# cap can still drag a small-context model into pointless prefill.
#
# These helpers surface the model's max context length and raise a
# structured OpenAI ``context_length_exceeded`` error when a prompt is
# too long, so the rejection lands BEFORE the engine starts prefill.

# Sentinel-large fallback used when the model exposes no useful context
# field. We do NOT silently bypass the gate (returning ``None`` would
# accept any prompt); instead we use a value so large that legitimate
# requests pass while the DoS pattern (≈ millions of tokens in one body)
# still trips. Sized for 8 MiB body cap × ~3.5 chars/token worst-case.

    falling back to the pre-#280 two-argument shape when the callable

    Rationale (codex r1 BLOCKING on PR #906): adding the
    ``enable_thinking`` parameter to the helper's forwarded call
    breaks backward compatibility for any third-party engine or test
    double still on the documented pre-#280 shape
    ``build_prompt(messages, tools=None)``. Without this compat
    shim two failure modes leak in:

      * In :func:`enforce_context_length_for_messages` the resulting

        bottom of the try-except and silently returns ``None`` —
        disabling the DoS gate for that engine.
      * In :func:`repair_messages_fit_context` the broad
        ``except Exception`` turns the same ``TypeError`` into
        ``return True``, skipping the actual fit check.

    Both shapes are silent regressions, so we prefer the call shape
    that matches the new contract but transparently fall back to
    the legacy shape if the callable raises ``TypeError`` on the
    unexpected kwarg. The fallback drops ``enable_thinking`` (the
    legacy engine never honoured it anyway, so the rendered prompt
    matches the legacy behaviour exactly — same prompt the engine
    would have produced pre-fix). Other ``TypeError``s propagate so
    they continue to surface as user-facing errors via the helper's
    existing exception sniff.

    The probe uses ``inspect.signature`` lazily (only on TypeError)

    only fires on the first call for an engine with the legacy

    Renders the prompt through the engine's chat template (same path
    used by ``BatchedEngine.build_prompt``), counts the tokens, then
    delegates to :func:`enforce_context_length`. Wraps the template /
    tokenization step in a permissive try-except so a metadata edge
    case (e.g. unloaded engine on a route stub) doesn't 500 — the
    downstream scheduler still has its own validation.

    Returns the integer prompt-token count so callers that already pay
    the build_prompt + tokenize cost can reuse it (e.g. Anthropic
    streaming usage's ``message_start.input_tokens`` plumbing). Returns
    ``None`` when the render or tokenization was skipped — MLLM engine,
    no ``build_prompt`` attribute, empty rendered prompt, or
    tokenizer-returned-zero — so callers can distinguish "no estimate
    available" from "real zero count" without re-parsing a sentinel
    overload (codex r4 NIT on PR #807). Existing call sites that
    discard the return value keep working unchanged — this is an
    additive contract change.

    Scoped to text-only engines: MLLM models accept image / video /
    audio inputs whose token cost is computed by the multimodal
    processor and tracked separately by ``MLLMScheduler``. The
    body-size middleware still bounds the wire-level payload for
    those routes.

    ``enable_thinking`` is forwarded to the engine's ``build_prompt``
    so the rendered template matches what the engine will actually
    generate against. Required for correct accounting on the
    R12-T1F / R12-T2F / R12-M2 auto-disable paths (PR #891 / #877 /
    #895): the chat / responses routes inject
    ``chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=False`` BEFORE this gate
    runs, but pre-fix the gate rendered with the template default
    (typically ``True`` on Qwen3 / DeepSeek-R1) — inflating the
    prompt-token estimate vs the prompt the engine actually emits.
    Two visible symptoms before the fix:

      * Requests that DO fit the model's context window were rejected
        with ``context_length_exceeded`` because the inflated estimate
        crossed the cap.
      * The H-06 #267b strict-json-schema repair gate
        (:func:`repair_messages_fit_context`) skipped retries that
        WOULD have fit if rendered with the resolved
        ``enable_thinking`` value.

    Default ``None`` preserves the legacy "let the template choose"
    behaviour for call sites that haven't been audited yet (e.g.
    ``routes/anthropic.py``, which does not run the auto-disable
    injection and so never had the divergence). Always thread the
    resolved value from sites that compute it.

    Used by chat, anthropic, and responses routes so the same DoS gate
    applies regardless of which compatibility surface the client uses.

    """Re-check the context-length gate for the R12-4 strict-mode
    repair-retry prompt (H-06 #267b).

    Codex review on PR #878 surfaced that ``build_repair_messages``
    builds a strictly LARGER prompt than the initial request — it
    prepends repair instructions, repeats the schema, and includes
    up to 4 KiB of the failed output. A request that passed the
    initial ``enforce_context_length_for_messages`` gate can therefore
    blow the context window only on the repair attempt and surface
    as ``502 strict_repair_engine_failure`` instead of a deterministic
    422 validation outcome.

    This helper mirrors :func:`enforce_context_length_for_messages`
    but RETURNS a boolean (``True`` = fits, ``False`` = does not
    fit) rather than raising. The caller skips the retry when this
    returns ``False`` and returns the ORIGINAL 422 envelope it would
    have returned without the retry — so the client always sees a
    consistent json-schema-violation outcome.

    On permissive-skip paths (MLLM engine, missing ``build_prompt``,
    empty rendered prompt, tokenizer-returned-zero) this returns
    ``True`` to preserve the existing behavior — the initial-request
    gate also skips those paths so the repair gate should not be
    stricter than the initial one. The strict-mode + tools combo is
    already rejected upstream by ``strict_with_tools_unsupported``,
    so for repair-prompt accounting the ``tools`` argument is
    effectively always ``None``; we still thread it through for
    contract symmetry with the initial gate.

    ``enable_thinking`` mirrors the same parameter on
    :func:`enforce_context_length_for_messages` — forward the
    resolved value so the repair-fit check renders the prompt the
    way the engine actually will. Pre-fix the helper rendered with
    ``enable_thinking=None`` (template default = ``True`` on
    thinking-capable models) while the repair turn ran with the
    resolved value (typically ``False`` under R12-T1F / R12-T2F /
    R12-M2 auto-disable), so the gate could SKIP a repair retry
    that would actually have fit. Default ``None`` preserves the
    legacy behaviour for unaudited call sites.

    Used by ``routes/chat.py`` and ``routes/responses.py`` so the
    same gate logic is applied at both call sites and cannot drift.
