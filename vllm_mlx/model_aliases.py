"""Model alias registry — single source of truth for known models.

Each entry in ``aliases.json`` is a per-alias profile: HF path + parser +
capability gates. Code that just needs ``alias → hf_path`` calls
``resolve_model``; code that needs the full profile (parser, hybrid
flag, spec-decode gate, …) calls ``resolve_profile``.

The legacy short form (``"alias": "hf_path"``) is still accepted for
backward compatibility with any external tool that hand-edits the file —
that entry just gets default capability flags.
