    Authoritative path: resolve through the alias registry FIRST. Every

    """Return the safetensors voice files cached for ``model_name``.

    R11-B-F1 (Bo 0.8.12 dogfood): pre-fix the route hard-coded a
    static voice list per family — ``["default"]`` for everything
    except kokoro / chatterbox. VibeVoice's HF repo ships per-language
    voice caches (``en-Grace_woman.safetensors``, ``en-Mike_man.safe
    tensors``, the eight non-English ``Spk0/Spk1`` pairs, ...) and NO
    ``default.safetensors`` — so EVERY ``/v1/audio/speech`` call 500'd:
    ``voice="default"`` -> ``FileNotFoundError`` deep in
    ``mlx_audio.tts.models.vibevoice.Model.load_voice``; a real name
    like ``en-Grace_woman`` -> the route's 400 ``invalid_voice``
    because the static list only contained ``"default"``.

    The fix is structural — enumerate the snapshot's ``voices/`` dir at
    validation time and use THAT list, instead of pinning a per-family
    constant. The helper:

    * Returns ``[]`` when the snapshot isn't cached locally — the
      caller falls back to the static list so the FIRST request (which
      triggers the download via ``load_model``) still proceeds. Once
      the snapshot is on disk every subsequent request validates
      against the true voice set.
    * Accepts both short aliases (``"vibevoice"``) and HF ids
      (``"mlx-community/VibeVoice-Realtime-0.5B-4bit"``) by going
      through ``huggingface_hub.try_to_load_from_cache`` on
      ``config.json`` to resolve the snapshot path. We never trigger a
      download here — this is a synchronous request-path call and
      blocking on a 500 MB pull would convert "validate voice" into
      "wait two minutes".
    * Strips the ``.safetensors`` suffix and sorts the result so the
      400 envelope's ``Available:`` preview is deterministic.

    Applies UNIFORMLY to every TTS family (kokoro, chatterbox,
    voxcpm, dia, vibevoice, ...). Chatterbox/voxcpm/dia ship a single
    ``default.safetensors`` so the enumeration returns ``["default"]``
    — same behaviour as the pre-fix static list. Kokoro's snapshot
    actually ships 50+ voice files (the pre-fix static list named only
    11), so the enumeration is a strict superset there.

    Local-only by design (``local_files_only=True``): we MUST NOT
    issue an HTTP roundtrip from inside ``_allowed_voices_for`` — the
    pre-flight 400 lookup runs before any weight load and a network
    stall would convert "client sent invalid voice" into "server
    appears to hang then times out".

                Kokoro-style single-letter code. Ignored by families that
                auto-detect language (Qwen3-TTS).
            instruct: Optional emotion/style instruction (e.g. "Very happy
                and excited."). Honoured by the Qwen3-TTS family — it maps to
                that engine's ``instruct`` argument. For CustomVoice it
                modulates the emotional delivery of the predefined speaker
                (``voice``). For VoiceDesign it is the PRIMARY control: the
                full voice (timbre, gender, age, accent, emotion, prosody) is
                described here in natural language and ``voice`` is ignored;
                if omitted a neutral narrator description is substituted
                (``QWEN3_TTS_VOICEDESIGN_DEFAULT_INSTRUCT``) so the mandatory
                arg is never missing. Other families ignore it (they have no
                emotion-control surface), so passing it is a no-op there
                rather than an error.
            voice_seed: Optional deterministic seed for Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign.
                Reusing the same ``instruct`` and seed reproduces the same
                designed voice across calls. Rejected for other families by
                the API route.
            ref_audio: Optional path to a reference audio clip for zero-shot
                voice cloning. Used by the F5-TTS ``f5`` family to clone the
                clip's timbre; by the Chatterbox family (optional — clones the
                ref timbre on top of its default voice); and by Qwen3-TTS
                **Base** (optional — the Base variant ignores ``voice`` when
                ``ref_audio`` is set, while CustomVoice ignores ``ref_audio``
                and keeps its named speaker); and by IndexTTS (required — it
                has no predefined speakers). Use a clean 5-10s clip at the
                model's native sample rate. Ignored by families without a
                cloning surface.
            ref_text: Optional transcript of ``ref_audio`` (its exact spoken
                text). Paired with ``ref_audio`` for F5-TTS cloning and to
                anchor Qwen3-TTS Base cloning. Ignored by families that clone
                reference-free.
            exaggeration: Chatterbox emotion/intensity knob (0.0 neutral →
                ~1.0 very expressive). Only the Chatterbox family honours it;
                it drives that engine's ``exaggeration`` argument and is the
                lever that de-flattens the delivery. Other families ignore it.

        * ``wav`` → Python's standard-library ``wave`` writer. Keeping this
          path independent of SciPy IO lets bounded clients retain only the
          ``scipy.signal`` resampling closure.

          ≥1.0). Always shipped via ``rapid-mlx[audio]``.
        * ``mp3`` → ``soundfile`` when libsndfile ≥1.1 (the version
          that bundled the LAME-backed MP3 writer). Older builds raise
          ``LibsndfileError`` which the caller surfaces as a 400 with
          an actionable hint (see ``UnsupportedAudioFormatError``).
        * ``aac`` → not supported by libsndfile in any current release;
          raises :class:`UnsupportedAudioFormatError` so the route can
          translate to a 400 listing the formats this build supports.
          We do NOT silently relabel WAV bytes as ``audio/aac``.
        * ``pcm`` → raw little-endian int16 PCM (no container). Mirrors
          OpenAI's ``response_format="pcm"`` contract.

        Raises:
            UnsupportedAudioFormatError: when the requested format
                cannot be produced by the available encoder stack.
                The route catches this and emits a 400 envelope so
