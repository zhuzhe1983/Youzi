# Task #292: conditional audio-route registration.
#
# Pre-fix the router was unconditionally ``include_router``'d on every
# ``rapid-mlx serve <text-only-model>`` install (Bo R13/R14 fuzz wave).
# Hitting ``/v1/audio/transcriptions`` on a text-only server then either
# 500'd (no audio engine loaded → engine.load() crashes inside the
# handler) or returned a misleading ``model_not_found`` envelope — the
# server appeared to advertise capabilities it didn't have.
#
# The fix splits route registration into a deferred ``register_audio_routes``
# helper. ``vllm_mlx.server`` calls it only when the loaded model is
# audio-capable (resolved through :mod:`vllm_mlx.audio.registry`) OR the
# operator passed ``--enable-audio``. On text-only servers the router is
# never attached, so FastAPI's stock 404 fires for the audio paths — the
# customer-visible outcome the dogfood report asked for.
#
# Two flags drive the gate:
#
# * ``ServerConfig.enable_audio_lane`` — operator opt-in via the
#   ``--enable-audio`` CLI flag.
# * The loaded model alias / HF id matches an entry in
#   :mod:`vllm_mlx.audio.registry` — every audio-mode boot path (Bo
#   R10-C1 ``_serve_audio_mode``) already resolves through the registry,
#   so the same predicate fires here without a separate config knob.
#
# ``AudioBodyLimitMiddleware`` (25 MB multipart cap) stays installed
# unconditionally on the app — it early-returns for paths outside
# ``_GUARDED_PATHS`` so the per-request cost on text routes is a single
# tuple membership test. Keeping it install-time avoids the Starlette
# warning that fires on ``add_middleware`` after the middleware stack
# has been built.

class AudioBodyLimitMiddleware:
    """ASGI middleware that bounds the request body of audio-upload
    routes BEFORE Starlette's multipart parser can spool it.

    Why ASGI middleware and not a FastAPI ``Depends``: when the route
    handler signature includes ``file: UploadFile``, Starlette's
    ``MultiPartParser`` runs as part of parameter resolution and reads
    the entire request body off the ``receive`` channel before any
    ``Depends`` callable is invoked. A ``Depends`` that inspects
    ``Content-Length`` therefore fires *after* the body has already been
    drained and spooled to ``SpooledTemporaryFile`` on disk —
    confirmed empirically with an ASGI ``receive`` probe.

    Running at the ASGI layer lets us short-circuit the receive loop
    in TWO complementary ways:

    1. **Honest-``Content-Length`` fast path** — if the advertised
       length exceeds the cap, return 413 immediately. Zero ``receive``
       calls, zero bytes on the server.

    2. **Chunked / no-``Content-Length`` slow path** — wrap ``receive``
       so it tallies streamed body bytes and returns a synthetic
       ``http.disconnect`` once the cap is exceeded. The middleware
       then emits 413. Starlette's multipart parser sees the
       disconnect, stops spooling, and unwinds — the server still
       lands at most ``MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_SIZE + slack`` bytes on disk
       (the threshold at which we trigger the abort), not the
       multi-GB body the attacker tried to send.

    Path scope is intentionally narrow — only
    ``/v1/audio/transcriptions`` uploads a file; ``/v1/audio/speech``
    and ``/v1/audio/voices`` have small JSON bodies bounded by other

#: Serialises the STT lane — BOTH transcription/translation and forced
#: alignment. One lock, not one per lane, and that matters.

#: The two lanes share no Python state (``_stt_engine`` and

#: runs MLX work against it. The lock keeps replacement and inference a single
#: lifecycle lease; actual MLX calls are dispatched to the server-owned model
#: worker so thread-local streams remain valid.
#:
#: An ``asyncio.Lock`` acquired ON THE EVENT LOOP, deliberately not a
#: ``threading.Lock`` held inside the worker. ``asyncio.to_thread`` uses
#: the shared default executor (min(32, cpu+4) threads), so queued
#: requests blocking on a thread-level lock would each pin an executor
#: thread just to wait — starving every other ``to_thread`` user in the
#: process (prefix-cache save, tool-grammar warmup). Waiting on the loop
#: instead costs a coroutine, not a thread, and only the request that
#: actually runs ever occupies an executor slot.

    Forced-alignment extension: if the request carries a ``text`` field,
    the route aligns that KNOWN transcript to the uploaded audio
    (per-character/word timestamps, zero recognition error) via
    :meth:`STTEngine.align` instead of running ASR. When ``text`` is
    present but ``model`` is omitted it defaults to the registered
    aligner alias (:data:`DEFAULT_ALIGNER_ALIAS`), and the response
    defaults to ``verbose_json`` so the timestamped ``segments`` are
    actually in the body. When ``text`` is absent the behaviour is
    unchanged.

    Two-layer size guard (defense in depth):

    1. :class:`AudioBodyLimitMiddleware` runs at the ASGI layer and
       rejects requests whose ``Content-Length`` exceeds the cap
       BEFORE Starlette's multipart parser drains the receive channel.
       Honest large uploads die there with zero disk I/O and no
       handler invocation.

    2. ``_stream_upload_to_tempfile`` (below) enforces the exact per-
       file cap while copying chunks into our own temp file. Catches
       chunked-transfer / no-``Content-Length`` clients that lied at
       layer 1: even if Starlette already spooled the body to its own
       ``SpooledTemporaryFile``, we refuse to copy more than the cap
       into ours and abort early before any STT engine import /
       ``.load()`` call happens.

    trap: "I sent the obvious value and got 400; what am I supposed

    the registry already advertises ``default_voice="af_heart"``.

    Resolution rule: when ``voice`` is the literal string ``"default"``

    coded the voice list to ``["default"]`` for everything except

    end-to-end 500:

    * VibeVoice ships per-language voice caches (``en-Grace_woman.
      safetensors``, ``en-Mike_man.safetensors``, the eight non-
      English ``Spk0/Spk1`` pairs) and NO ``default.safetensors``,

    * A real file name like ``en-Grace_woman`` 400'd here because
      the static list only contained ``"default"``.

    The fix is to enumerate the snapshot's ``voices/`` dir at
    request time and use THAT list — see
    :func:`vllm_mlx.audio.tts._list_snapshot_voices`. This applies
    uniformly to every TTS family: chatterbox / voxcpm / dia ship a
    single ``default.safetensors`` so the enumeration returns the
    same ``["default"]`` the pre-fix static list had; kokoro ships
    50+ voice files (the pre-fix static list listed only 11) so the
    enumeration is a strict superset.

    Fallback path: when the snapshot isn't cached locally (first
    request, fresh install) the enumeration returns ``[]`` and we
    fall back to the per-family static list. That way the FIRST
    ``/v1/audio/speech`` call — which triggers the snapshot download
    via ``load_model`` — still passes voice validation against the
    registry default. After the snapshot lands the next request
    validates against the true voice set. The registry's

    """Whether ``model_name`` can clone a voice from an inline reference.

    Four TTS families condition synthesis on a ``ref_audio`` reference
    clip sent on ``/v1/audio/speech``:

    * **F5-TTS** — always conditions on a reference waveform.
    * **Chatterbox** — optionally clones the reference timbre on top of
      its default voice (its engine branch forwards ``ref_audio``).
    * **IndexTTS** — requires a reference clip and has no named speakers.
    * **Qwen3-TTS Base** — the ``...-Base-...`` repo clones a voice
      zero-shot from the reference. Its CustomVoice sibling does NOT
      clone: it keeps a predefined named speaker and ignores
      ``ref_audio``.

    The verdict MUST stay in lock-step with
    :meth:`vllm_mlx.audio.tts.TTSEngine._detect_family`: a model this
    gate deems clone-capable while the engine classifies into a
    non-cloning family would skip voice validation here yet drop
    ``ref_audio`` in the engine — a silent 200 with the wrong (default)
    voice. So the F5 and Chatterbox checks use the SAME whole-id
    substrings the engine uses (``f5-tts``/``f5_tts`` and ``chatterbox``),
    NOT a broad ``f5`` token that would catch an unrelated ``org/f5-foo``
    the engine treats as Kokoro.

    Qwen3-TTS Base is classified on the repo NAME (last path component)
    split into ``-``/``_`` tokens — mirroring the Base-reject guard so
    an org segment (``customvoice-org/...``) or an unrelated ``base``
    elsewhere in the path can't flip the verdict. A repo name containing
    ``qwen3-tts`` is necessarily a substring of the full id, so whenever
    this returns True for Base the engine also detects ``qwen3_tts`` and
    forwards the reference — the dangerous direction cannot occur.
