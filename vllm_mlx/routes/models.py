"""Model listing endpoints.

The OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint lists only loaded models and
their routable aliases. Both it and `/v1/models/{id}` retain ``ModelInfo``
shapes with additive Rapid-MLX vendor extensions
(see ``api/models.ModelInfo``). The extensions surface per-alias
profile data — curated sampling, hybrid/MoE flags, parser pair,
modality — pulled from ``model_aliases.resolve_profile``. OpenAI
clients ignore the extra fields per spec; rapid-desktop reads
them to auto-apply calibrated defaults so a user opening a chat
on ``qwen3.5-9b-4bit`` doesn't have to hand-tune sliders.

    The currently-loaded engine knows the real cap — it's the same
    chain the request-time context-length guard consults
    (``service.helpers.get_model_max_context``), so advertising it on
    ``/v1/models`` keeps the client's "max tokens" slider lined up

    rapid-desktop's PR #318 consumer needs this to auto-scale the
    chat-input cap; absent the field the consumer fell through to a
    desktop-side per-family heuristic that drifted out of sync with
    every long-context release.

    Resolution:
      * Single-model serve — ``cfg.engine`` is THE loaded engine and
        the route's only entries are ``cfg.model_name`` and
        ``cfg.model_alias``; both surface the same window.
      * Multi-model serve — look up the matching ``ModelEntry`` via
        the registry's index (NOT ``get_engine`` which falls back to
        the default engine on miss; that would advertise the wrong
        cap for an unloaded alias).
      * No live engine for ``model_id`` — return ``None`` so the
        client falls back to its own per-family default. The desktop
        carries that fallback as defense-in-depth.

    Failures inside ``get_model_max_context`` (missing attributes,
    tokenizer probe raises) must NOT 500 the listing endpoint — they
    fall through to ``None`` and the request still completes. The
    helper's own fallback (``_FALLBACK_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS = 4 Mi``)
    is a DoS sentinel for the request-time guard, NOT a number worth
    advertising to clients; we suppress it here by treating any
    integer ≥ ``_DOS_SENTINEL_FLOOR`` as "no useful value" so the

    ``is_text_only`` is authoritative: when the alias pins the checkpoint
    to the text lane (``is_text_only=True`` — e.g. Ternary-Bonsai-27B,
    whose vision tower we don't serve), the wire must advertise ``text``
    and never ``image``, even though the checkpoint's ``config.json``
    declares a ``vision_config`` that ``is_mllm_model`` would otherwise
    match. Advertising vision for a text-only-served model would make
    clients send image content the engine can't accept.

    ``AliasProfile.modality`` is an engine-routing discriminator:
    ``text`` selects the AR ``BatchedEngine`` lane, ``text-diffusion``
    selects the diffusion lane. Vision-Language aliases (qwen3-vl-*,

    the multimodal path is layered on top via ``MLLMBatchGenerator``,
    not a separate engine. Reusing the routing discriminator as the
    externally-reported modality therefore mislabels VL models as
    text-only and downstream clients skip the image content shapes
    they otherwise would have sent (F-067).

    The fix derives the reported value from the same ``is_mllm_model``
    detector the rest of the codebase already trusts to gate VLM
    routing (see ``cli.py``/``server.py``: ``is_mllm=getattr(args,
    "mllm", False) or is_mllm_model(args.model)``). This keeps engine
    routing untouched while reporting an accurate capability hint on

    1. **Per-entry live state** — when a ``ModelEntry`` is loaded for
       ``model_id`` (multi-model serve, or single-model serve that
       populated the registry), the entry's ``tool_call_parser`` /

       auto-detect outcome — :func:`server.load_model` writes them
       AFTER ``_detect_native_tool_support`` has resolved the final
       values.
    2. **Per-server live state (single-model)** — for single-model
       serves that don't go through the registry, fall back to the
       ``ServerConfig`` globals (which mirror ``server._tool_call_parser``
       and ``server._reasoning_parser_name``). Same gating as
       :func:`_tools_capable`: the server-global parsers ONLY apply
       to the model the server is currently serving, never to
       unrelated registry / discovery ids.
    3. **Alias profile default** — the values declared in
       ``aliases.json`` and surfaced via ``AliasProfile``. Used for
       discovery clients pre-flighting tool-call support on aliases
       they're considering switching to (the runtime isn't actually
       running them yet).
    4. **None** — preserves the existing wire shape for ids with no
       live runtime AND no alias profile entry.

    R12 MED-1 (Vlad + Sven dogfood, rapid-mlx 0.8.15): pre-fix the

    parsers (and human operators debugging tool-call issues) saw
    misleading nulls. This helper is the single source of truth for
    "what parsers does the runtime actually have bound for this id".

    Exception-tolerant by design: the route must stay 200 even when
    the registry mutates mid-iteration or the server module fails to
    import (test isolation, partial-init). Any failure collapses to
