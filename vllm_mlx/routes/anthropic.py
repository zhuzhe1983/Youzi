    constraint, so a small model can happily defy the pin and emit a
    call to a different tool (the Sergei repro hit qwen3.5-4b on a
    two-tool prompt where the model fired BOTH the pinned tool AND the
    un-pinned one). Pre-fix, the downstream JSON-schema validator
    (F-220) then 400-ed on the un-pinned tool's argument schema —
    leaking validation across a tool the user never asked for and
    silently breaking ``tool_choice``.

    Policy: when the choice pins a specific tool, KEEP only the calls
    to that tool and drop the rest with a warning. This matches the

    the F-220 validator scoped to the pinned tool. ``"auto"`` /

    case to filter.

    Chat.py's named-function path 422s on the same mismatch (see
    ``routes/chat.py:1665``). The two routes intentionally diverge on
    the "got pinned + extras" case: ``/v1/chat/completions`` mirrors
    OpenAI's strict contract (422), while ``/v1/messages`` mirrors
    Anthropic's more forgiving "deliver the pinned tool's call"
    contract — a 422 on an extra call would surface a confusing error
    to clients that pinned the very tool the response already
    carries. They CONVERGE on the "got zero pinned calls" case, which
    is handled by ``_enforce_named_tool_choice_present`` below (PR
    #763 codex round-1 BLOCKING #1: a filter that emptied the list
    plus a downstream "no tool_calls? end_turn." branch would 200
    with no ``tool_use`` block at all, silently violating the
    forced-tool contract).

    D-ANTHRO-TOOL-USAGE F5: the Anthropic streaming surface previously
    hard-coded ``message_start.usage.input_tokens=0`` because the engine
    hadn't run yet — but billing dashboards parsing the SSE stream
    therefore under-reported the input share by 100%. Anthropic's
    public stream emits ``input_tokens`` in ``message_start`` (the
    server-side estimate, finalised in ``message_delta``).

    Uses the SAME ``count_prompt_tokens`` helper the DoS gate
    (``enforce_context_length_for_messages``) already calls so the
    estimate is byte-for-byte consistent with what the context-length
    pre-check used. The render goes through ``engine.build_prompt`` so
    chat-template / tools rendering matches what the engine itself
    will tokenise during generation.

    Returns ``0`` when:

      * the engine has no ``build_prompt`` (MLLM / mock test stub) —
        the streaming usage path falls back to the engine-reported
        ``output.prompt_tokens`` like before, and the public-API
        contract just degrades to the pre-fix ``input_tokens=0`` shape
        rather than fabricating a tokenizer-free count.
      * the template render or tokenizer call raises — same fallback
        rationale; surfacing a tokenizer error here would obscure the

    """Return a list of ``input_json_delta.partial_json`` fragments
    whose concatenation equals ``json.dumps(tool_input)``.

    R-08 (r5-A bundle) — Anthropic's streaming spec emits
    ``input_json_delta`` progressively as the model generates the
    tool arguments. Local inference produces the full JSON
    structurally (the parser only surfaces tool_calls once the
    arguments object closes), so we can't stream per-token; the
    next best is to emit one fragment per top-level key-value pair
    so a consumer that parses-as-it-goes (the documented use case
    for ``input_json_delta``) gets at least the same number of cues
    an Anthropic-side stream would.

    Codex r5 NIT (PR #826): the structural braces are attached to
    their adjacent key-value fragments — the first pair carries the
    opening ``{`` and the last pair carries the closing ``}`` — so
    every emitted fragment is a complete structural addition to the
    accumulating JSON. The earlier draft emitted standalone ``{``
    and ``}`` fragments, which strictly satisfied the
    byte-concatenation contract but surfaced empty-value cues to
    progressive consumers (the first event carried no key/value
    payload, just a brace). Pairing the braces with their adjacent
    pair removes those empty cues while keeping
    ``"".join(fragments) == json.dumps(tool_input)`` exactly.

    Empty / non-string-keyed / non-dict inputs return a single
    fragment so the wire contract (at least one ``input_json_delta``
    per tool block) holds; concatenating that single fragment still
    yields the exact ``json.dumps`` bytes.

    Codex r1 NIT #3: the per-pair split path is only safe when every
    dict key is a string — ``json.dumps`` coerces ``int`` / ``bool``
    keys to their string form (``{1: "x"}`` → ``{"1": "x"}``), and
    ``json.dumps(1)`` would emit ``1`` (no quotes), breaking the
    concatenation contract. Fall back to the monolithic shard for
    those shapes so byte-equivalence holds regardless of input.

    # ``aliases.json``, the streaming path must NEVER open a
    # ``thinking`` content block — Anthropic's public API doesn't
    # emit one for non-extended-thinking models, so any client that
    # branches on ``content_block.type == "thinking"`` would
    # mis-detect capability. Applied via ``_gate_thinking_pieces``
    # below to every place this function constructs
    # ``("thinking", ...)`` pieces: channel-routed (engine
    # OutputRouter), reasoning-parser delta split, and the raw
    # ``<think>`` think_router heuristic. When the gate fires the
    # reasoning bytes are demoted to a ``text`` piece so the
    # assistant turn still surfaces the model's output (silent drop
    # is the worse failure mode, #569).

    # Resolution: consult the per-request registry entry first
    # (multi-model mode), fall back to the global parser pair in
    # single-model mode (codex r1 BLOCKING on PR #705). Inlined here
    # so the predicate consumes the SAME ``cfg`` object the rest of
    # this function already reads — sharing avoids a second

    # ``anthropic_route.get_config`` would miss.
    #
    # Capability is captured ONCE at request entry and frozen in the

        Two concerns, in one pass:

        1. **Non-thinking alias demotion.** When ``_reasoning_enabled``
           is False (per-request alias has ``reasoning_parser: null``
           in ``aliases.json``), every ``("thinking", text)`` piece is
           rewritten to ``("text", text)``. The rewrite preserves order
           so downstream ``_emit_content_pieces`` still merges
           consecutive same-type pieces into a single content block.

        2. **No-empty-block parity with non-stream.** The non-stream
           ``openai_to_anthropic`` predicate skips a thinking block when
           ``reasoning_text.strip() == ""``. Mirror that on the
           streaming surface so a model that emits ``<think> </think>``
           or a whitespace-only reasoning channel delta does NOT open a
           thinking ``content_block_start`` + whitespace
           ``thinking_delta`` that Claude Code surfaces as a blank
           thought bubble.

        The whitespace guard is **state-aware**: a whitespace-only
        thinking piece is only dropped when it would OPEN a blank
        thinking block — i.e. no thinking block is currently open in
        the SSE stream (``current_block_type != "thinking"``) AND no
        later piece in this batch carries non-whitespace thinking
        content that would mark the leading whitespace as an
        intra-thinking separator. This preserves the
        ``"first" + "\n\n" + "second"`` shape that the model uses to
        break thinking into paragraphs without leaking the
        ``"   " -> open empty block`` shape (codex r3 MAJOR probe 1,
        refined per codex r4 MAJOR).

        ``current_block_type`` is the block type currently OPEN at the
        downstream emitter (None / "text" / "thinking") — when it's
        "thinking" we ALWAYS keep whitespace because it's an intra-block
        continuation, never a block opener.

        #       "length"`` guard below blocks suppression.
