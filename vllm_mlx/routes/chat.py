    Returns ``{"mode": "required"}``, ``{"mode": "named", "name": <str>}``, or
    ``{"mode": "auto"}`` for the three constrainable modes, or ``None`` to skip
    grammar constraint entirely (``"none"`` / a malformed object form).

    WHY A TAGGED FORM (deferred codex #2 — string collision): per the OpenAI
    spec ``tool_choice`` is EITHER a string enum (``"auto" | "required" |
    "none"``) OR an object ``{"type":"function","function":{"name":...}}``. A
    tool NAME only ever appears inside the object form — never as a bare
    string. So a tool literally named ``"required"`` (or ``"auto"`` /
    ``"none"``) under ``tool_choice="auto"`` must be treated as AUTO (the tool
    stays available; the AUTO grammar lets the model choose to call it or not),
    and selecting it requires the object form
    ``{"type":"function","function":{"name":"required"}}``. Discriminating on
    SHAPE here — bare string vs object — before any comparison against tool
    names makes the string-enum path and the named-tool path structurally
    unable to collide. The tool name is only ever read out of the object.

    PR-5 SCOPE (auto default-on): ``"required"`` and the named object form are
    constrained to force a call; ``"auto"`` and ``None``/absent (auto by
    default) map to ``{"mode": "auto"}`` — the auto-path grammar (a free
    text/reasoning prefix OR a structurally-correct tool_call) that the model
    may satisfy with ZERO calls, so auto NEVER forces a call (that would turn
    auto into required — the #1 regression this path guards against). ``"none"``
    returns ``None`` (the model sees no tools; the #445 route handler already
    drops ``request.tools``). A malformed object form (no usable name) also
    degrades to ``None`` — free-form, rather than fabricating a constraint.

def _line1_split_reasoning_for_tool_parse(reasoning_parser, text):
    """LINE① (#558, codex r4 #4) — upstream-faithful reasoning-first split.

    Return the post-``</think>`` content the tool parser should see. NEVER returns
    the raw full text: the caller invokes this ONLY for an ENGAGED gate, where the
    real call is guaranteed AFTER ``</think>``, so exposing the ``<think>`` span to
    the tool parser (even on a parser error) would re-open the very leak this closes.

    This mirrors what vLLM (``Parser.parse``: ``reasoning, content =
    extract_reasoning(model_output)`` then ``_extract_tool_calls(content)``) and
    SGLang (``_build_chat_response``: ``parse_non_stream`` then ``_process_tool_
    calls`` on the cleaned text) do for EVERY reasoning model — split reasoning off
    FIRST, then parse tool calls only on the remainder. Because the split runs on
    the DECODED string, a tool-call opener that appears inside ``<think>`` is
    discarded before the tool parser ever sees it. That is the structural (not
    best-effort) close for codex r4 #4: masking the opener token id at generation
    time cannot prove the trigger TEXT is unspellable inside the think span, but
    reasoning-first extraction discards that span before the parser runs.

    KNOWN RESIDUAL (codex r7 #1), matching upstream: the split boundary is the
    DECODED ``</think>`` text, whereas the runtime grammar gate opens on the ATOMIC
    ``</think>`` token id (``ReasonerGrammarObject``: ``int(t) == reasoning_end_id``).
    The two agree for every honest model (a reasoning model emits ``</think>`` as its
    template's atomic special token), but an ADVERSARIAL model that sub-token-SPELLS
    both ``</think>`` and a tool opener inside its reasoning could plant a false text
    boundary the splitter honours. We deliberately do NOT preserve a token-id
    boundary here: (a) vLLM/SGLang — the sources this mirrors — also split on decoded
    text and carry the same residual, so closing it would EXCEED the upstream
    contract raullen scoped this to; (b) it is strictly NON-REGRESSIVE — the pre-line①
    path parsed tool calls on the ENTIRE raw output including all reasoning, so
    reasoning-first extraction only ever SHRINKS this surface; (c) the coupled budget
    force-closes the real atomic ``</think>`` regardless, so a well-behaved call still
    lands after the true boundary. A token-id-anchored split (thread the gen-time gate
    position into post-processing) is the sound-but-beyond-upstream follow-up.

    FAIL CLOSED (codex r5 #3, r6 B2/B3): the configured ``cfg.reasoning_parser``
    (consistent with ``_finalize_content_and_reasoning``) is tried first, but its
    ``content`` is trusted ONLY when the parser POSITIVELY identified a reasoning
    span (``reasoning is not None``). A parser that reports "no reasoning found" as
    ``(None, text)`` returns the FULL raw output as ``content``; trusting that would
    re-open the leak (codex r6 B2), so on ``reasoning is None`` we ignore ``content``
    and fall through to the literal split. When the parser is absent, raises, or
    found no reasoning we deterministically locate the span after the FIRST
    ``</think>`` literal (codex r6 B3: the FIRST close tag is the real reasoning
    boundary — a schema-valid tool argument may itself contain the literal
    ``</think>``, and splitting on the LAST occurrence would truncate the call). If
    there is no close tag the model never closed thinking, so there is no legitimate
    post-think call and we return ``""`` (the tool parser sees nothing). Either way
    the think span never reaches the parser.

    Applied ONLY when line① is engaged (the caller gates on
    ``_line1_gate_engaged``): line①'s gate + coupled thinking budget GUARANTEE the
    real forced call lands strictly AFTER ``</think>``, so parsing only post-think
    content loses nothing legitimate. Families that legitimately emit a tool call
    INSIDE ``<think>`` (minimax bare ``<invoke>``, forced-prefix hermes/qwen3) never
    engage line① — their multi-token openers fail the single-special-token gate —
    so a blanket reorder is unsafe but this gated one is not.

    (codex #558-PR3 blocking): the eligibility gate + ``_try_admit`` MUST run
    before any ``submit`` so a compile flood past the cap never queues unbounded
    work. Returns ``None`` (free-form fallback) when the request is ineligible,
    admission is refused (at capacity), submission fails, or the build errors.

    A CANCELLED caller (client disconnect) does NOT return ``None``: the
    ``asyncio.CancelledError`` is deliberately NOT caught here — it propagates to
    unwind the request (codex #558-PR3 round-7 nit). The underlying compile is
    ``asyncio.shield``-ed, so it keeps running to genuine completion and releases
    its admission slot via the done-callback; only the caller's await is
    abandoned.

    The cheap eligibility gate runs SYNCHRONOUSLY so the vast majority of traffic
    (no tools, ``"auto"``/``"none"``) never enters the thread pool. Only an
    eligible+admitted request pays the off-loop build — it compiles a
    client-controlled grammar and, on the first request for a tokenizer, does the
    ~1s ``LLTokenizer`` build; running that inline would block the event loop.

    Admission is released via ``add_done_callback`` on the UNDERLYING
    ``concurrent.futures.Future`` — NOT a ``try/finally`` around the await
    (codex #558-PR3 blocking). A ``finally`` fires the instant the AWAIT is
    cancelled (client disconnect) while the worker keeps compiling; a disconnect
    flood would then release slots early and let more than the cap run at once.
    The done-callback fires only when the compile ACTUALLY finishes (success,
    error, or cancel), so admission stays accurate under cancellation.

    Designed for the D-TOOLCHOICE-R1 T3 case: qwen3 + tool_choice=
    required emits something like ::

        <tool_call>
        {"name": "add_numbers", "arguments": 4128, 7591}
        </parameter>
        </function>
        </tool_call>

    where the parser's strict pattern fails (``arguments`` is not a
    JSON object) so the chat route synthesises a call with empty
    ``"{}"`` arguments. The empty-args result is uselessly opaque for
    the client — but the raw text itself often contains enough signal
    to reconstruct *something* better than ``"{}"``. Two recovery
    routes are tried, both bounded so a hostile or genuinely
    unparseable response degrades safely back to ``None``:

    1. **Strict object body.** If the raw text contains a literal
       ``"arguments":`` followed by a balanced JSON object, return
       that object's text. This handles the common case where the
       model emitted valid JSON but failed an outer wrapper (closing
       tag missing, wrong wrapper element).

    2. **No structural recovery possible.** Return ``None``. The
       caller falls back to the existing ``"{}"`` default.

    Intentionally narrow: we do NOT try to coerce the malformed
    qwen3 shape ``"arguments": 4128, 7591`` into a positional-args
    interpretation — there is no schema-agnostic way to map two bare
    integers to named parameters without guessing. The fallback to
    ``"{}"`` plus a downstream ``_validate_tool_call_params`` warning
    is the right contract for that case (the client retries with a
    clearer prompt or a named-function ``tool_choice``).

    codex r4 BLOCKING #1: when ``expected_name`` is provided, also
    verify that the recovered candidate is paired with a
    ``"name": "<expected>"`` field in the same wire span. Without
    this gate, a synth for a named ``tool_choice`` whose target is
    ``"my_target"`` could pick up an unrelated
    ``{"name": "other_tool", "arguments": {...}}`` block elsewhere
    in the response and ship ``other_tool``'s args under the
    forced target's name — a subtle correctness bug because the
    synthesized call's ``function.name`` would not match the args'
    intended schema. We REQUIRE a name match within a 512-byte
    window of the ``"arguments"`` marker (covers a typical inner
    wire body), and FALL BACK to ``"{}"`` (return ``None``) when no
    match exists.

# Parser-wire literal markers that MUST be scrubbed from ``content`` /
# ``reasoning_content`` when ``tool_choice="required"`` synthesises a
# call to recover from a malformed model emission (D-TOOLCHOICE-R1 T3).
# Without this scrub, the model's failed tool-call attempt — literal
# ``<tool_call>...`` text the parser couldn't extract — leaks into
# both user-visible fields.
#
# Each entry is ``(opener_regex, closer_regex_or_None)``. The scrubber
# is two-phase:
#
#   1. **Balanced pairs**: when both opener and closer are present,
#      strip the entire span ``opener…closer``. Non-greedy so
#      consecutive blocks each get their own match.
#   2. **Unmatched standalone markers**: any opener/closer literal
#      that survives phase 1 (e.g. an orphan ``</function>`` or a
#      stray ``<tool_call>`` with no closer because the model
#      truncated mid-body) gets stripped as a bare token.
#
# Critically, phase 2 strips ONLY the marker bytes themselves — it
# does NOT delete from the orphan opener to EOF. Codex r1 BLOCKING #1
# caught this: the prior ``opener.*?(?:closer|\Z)`` pattern would eat
# all trailing reasoning/prose whenever the model emitted an unclosed
# opener mid-thought. The new two-phase split preserves trailing
# content while still scrubbing the marker itself, so a model
# response shaped like ``<tool_call>{junk}</tool_call>then prose``
# yields ``then prose`` and ``<tool_call>{junk}\nthen prose`` yields
# ``{junk}\nthen prose`` (the body is left for the reasoning parser
# to consume, but the visible ``<tool_call>`` marker is gone).
#
# The list covers every wire opener/closer pair we know about
# (hermes / qwen3coder / nemotron / deepseek / glm / minimax /

    Channel-routed paths (harmony / gemma4) bypass the text parser
    entirely — the ``OutputRouter`` extracts structured tool_calls

    a forced ``tool_choice`` succeeds on harmony because the model

    produced text that the parser failed to recognise.

    The OpenAI ``tool_choice`` contract is parser-agnostic: when the

    symmetry we synthesise a tool_call server-side when the target tool
    is unambiguous (named-function, or ``"required"`` with a single

    tied ``embed_tokens`` (qwen3 and most MLX text models).

    Resolution is by STRUCTURED fixed paths only — the canonical head locations
    across the model families we serve: a flat mlx-lm text model exposes
    ``lm_head``/``model.lm_head`` (untied) or ``model.embed_tokens`` (tied); a
    multimodal-capable wrapper (qwen3_5, gemma3n, …) nests these under
    ``language_model[.model]``. The #1185 regression was exactly a MISSING fixed
    path — qwen3.5's tied head at ``language_model.model.embed_tokens.weight`` —
    now covered below.

    We deliberately do NOT tree-walk for a head by module name: a module named
    ``lm_head`` anywhere in the tree is not necessarily the TEXT output head (a
    vision/draft/MTP head can share the name), and validating ``</think>``
    against the wrong head's width is unsound (codex). An unrecognized nesting
    therefore returns ``None`` → ``_engine_output_vocab_size`` declines → the
    budget falls back to the safe post-hoc cap (correct, just no decode-time
    force until that family's fixed path is added). All ``lm_head`` (untied,

    This is the AUTHORITATIVE reasoning cap for text-parser families: once the
    model has spent ``reasoning_max_tokens`` inside its ``<think>…</think>``
    span, the next-token logits are OVERRIDDEN so the only sampleable token is
    the single ``</think>`` id — the exact lever vLLM (``ThinkingBudgetState-
    Holder``), SGLang (``ReasonerGrammarObject``) and mlx-vlm (``ThinkingBudget-
    Criteria``) use. It REPLACES the post-hoc char-count trim: when this returns
    a processor, ``_effective_posthoc_reasoning_cap`` suppresses the post-hoc cap
    so the two never both run (single mechanism, one source of truth).

    Called from the route only once the request is committed to generation.

    Gating (each returns ``None`` → post-hoc cap retained):
      * Thinking must be DEFINITIVELY on — ``_effective_enable_thinking`` is
        ``True`` (mirrors what ``apply_chat_template`` does to pre-inject
        ``<think>``). A thinking-OFF request (explicit off / coder default) OR an
        unknown-model default (``None``) is skipped, so we never install an
        unseeded processor that can't fire yet still suppresses the post-hoc cap
        (guards vLLM #39130: never force a reasoning-end that cannot occur).
      * TOOL requests opt out — UNLESS ``allow_tools`` (LINE① #558): a mid-span
        force-close could inject ``</think>`` after a tool-call opener and corrupt
        the call ONLY when the tool grammar/parser is active DURING the think span
        (vLLM #44676 — the UNGATED ``tool_choice="auto"`` parser path). LINE①'s
        forced grammar is REASONING-GATED (its mask is held OFF until ``</think>``
        via the runtime token-id gate), so the constrained region begins strictly
        AFTER the boundary and the force-closed ``</think>`` cannot land mid-call.
        The route passes ``allow_tools=True`` EXACTLY when that gate is active
        (``GrammarLogitsProcessor.reasoning_gate_id is not None``), COUPLING the
        budget to the gate — the same structural coupling SGLang enforces (its
        ``ReasonerGrammarObject`` never installs the budget without the gate) and
        the same reason vLLM applies the budget to structured requests without a
        tool opt-out (budget and grammar are temporally disjoint). Every other
        tool request keeps the opt-out (protects the ungated auto/parser path).
      * A request that lists ``</think>`` (or an overlapping substring) in
        ``stop`` opts out — forcing ``</think>`` would trip that client stop AT
        the reasoning boundary; the post-hoc cap (which appends ``</think>`` to
        the FINAL text, not through the decode-time stop matcher) still enforces
        the budget with no behaviour change vs pre-feature.
      * ``build_budget_from_render`` returns ``None`` for any model whose
        ``</think>`` is not a single token (channel-routed gpt-oss / harmony).

    Whether the span is SEEDED (template prefills ``<think>``) vs EMITTED (the
    model generates it) is derived from the TEMPLATE'S generation-prefix delta
    (``_template_generation_prefix``), never from raw conversation content.

    #   * F-051: ``tool_call_id`` is REQUIRED on every tool message.
    #     Without it, the tool reply has no provenance — the previously
    #     accepted shape rendered the result into context unlinked
    #     (effectively an attacker-controlled "extra user turn").
    #
    #   * F-112: ``tool_call_id`` MUST reference the ``id`` of a
    #     ``tool_calls[*]`` entry on a PRIOR assistant message in the
    #     same ``messages[]`` array. Orphan tool turns were accepted as
    #     200 and rendered into the prompt as if they were authoritative
    #     tool replies — a direct prompt-injection vector (e.g. an
    #     attacker-controlled ``content: "the password is OMEGA"``
    #     reached the model with no anchoring assistant tool_call).
    #
    #   * F-111: ``role:"tool"`` content MUST be text-only (a string or
    #     a ``[{type:"text",text:str}]`` array). The OpenAI spec does
    #     not define multimodal tool replies, and a non-text part on a
    #     tool reply was previously silently dropped by every text-only
    #     chat template — the model received an empty
    #     ``<tool_response>`` and hallucinated. The text-only array is
    #     accepted here and flattened to a string downstream by
    #     ``utils/chat_template.py::_normalize_text_only_content_arrays``;
    #     this validator only rejects the non-text shapes the
    #     normalization can't safely flatten.
    #
    # All three checks live up-front (BEFORE engine work) so the failure
    # mode is a clean 400 with a precise pointer at the offending
    # message — not a 500 from a downstream renderer crash. F-051 is
    # closed as a freebie by the ``tool_call_id`` REQUIRED check.
    #
    # We track tool_call ids as a CONSUMABLE pending set rather than a
    # monotonically-growing seen-set: each ``assistant.tool_calls[*].id``
    # is a single-use ticket that the next matching ``role:"tool"`` reply
    # consumes. Without this, a client can submit a valid tool reply,

    #       (parser couldn't extract from a malformed wire body), OR
    #   (b) the parser DID extract a call but ``tool_choice="required"``
    #       was set AND the raw wire had cross-family / orphan markers
    #       the parser's cleanup left behind (e.g. qwen3 emits
    #       ``<tool_call>{json}</function>`` — hermes recovers the JSON
    #       but the trailing ``</function>`` survives as content).
    #
    # Both conditions imply the model attempted a tool call and any
    # wire literals in the output are junk by definition. The scrub
    # is parser-agnostic so adding a new parser doesn't reopen the
    # leak; codex r3 BLOCKING #2 caught case (b) — even the
    # recover-args path needs the scrub.
    # codex r4 BLOCKING #2: the broad gate ``tool_choice is not None``
    # also fired on ``tool_choice="auto"``, where a model legitimately
    # may emit prose alongside a tool call that contains XML/tool
    # marker text (e.g. discussing the tool wire format in the prose).
    # Narrow to forced/required modes only — that's where the wire
    # leakage is structurally known to be junk by construction:
    #   - ``tool_choice="required"`` — model was FORCED to call,
    #     so any wire-shaped leftovers are by-products of that forcing.
    #   - ``tool_choice={"type":"function","function":{"name":X}}`` —
    #     same forcing semantics.
    # ``"auto"`` and ``"none"`` keep the prior pre-0.8.3 behaviour —
    # cleaned_text is the parser's authoritative output.
    # codex r6 BLOCKING #1: gate scrub on the presence of an actual
    # wire-marker leak in ``cleaned_text``, not on every successful
    # forced/required call. A clean parser-extracted call whose
    # ``cleaned_text`` is plain prose (even prose that legitimately
    # discusses ``<tool_call>``) keeps its content unmodified —
    # which it MUST, because the scrub is destructive (rewrites the
    # user-visible field).
    #
    # The final firing condition is intentionally stricter than "a
    # forced call exists": forced synthesis can also happen when a
    # model ignores ``tool_choice="required"`` and emits ordinary
    # prose. Scrub only when the visible text contains STRUCTURAL

    """R12-4 — streaming variant of post-generate strict enforcement.

    Streams the unconstrained chat completion as ``stream_chat_completion``
    would, but buffers the per-delta content deltas client-side. After
    the upstream stream emits ``[DONE]`` we run the same
    :func:`validate_and_envelope` check used by the non-streaming
    path. On failure we synthesize ONE extra terminal chunk carrying
    ``finish_reason="json_schema_violation"`` plus a non-content
    ``error`` event before re-emitting ``[DONE]``.

    The asymmetry vs. the non-streaming path is intentional:
    streaming clients have already received the content tokens so a
    silent in-place 422 is impossible (the wire is already open).
    Surfacing the violation as an extra finish_reason value lets
    spec-aware clients distinguish "the server detected a strict
    contract breach" from a normal ``stop`` finish, while
    spec-unaware clients still see the content they need to retry
    against. The repair retry is deliberately NOT run here — re-
    prompting after a stream is in flight would require either
    closing the wire (defeating SSE) or attributing the retry tokens
    to the first stream's ``response_id`` (defeating the client's
    ability to distinguish them).

    Buffering rule: we accumulate the ``content`` deltas from each
    SSE chunk's ``choices[0].delta.content`` field, IGNORING
    ``reasoning_content`` (which is not part of the user-visible
    JSON the schema is supposed to constrain). If a future chunk
    format adds a different content surface we'll need to extend the
    accumulator — the buffer payload is small (one JSON object) so
    the memory cost of "buffer the whole stream" is trivial.
