"""Prometheus ``/metrics`` exposition endpoint (issue #701).

A single unauthenticated ``GET /metrics`` route that renders the existing
counters/gauges exposed by ``engine.get_stats()`` / ``scheduler.get_stats()``
in Prometheus text exposition format.

Design choices
--------------
- **No new runtime dependency.** The text exposition format is short and
  well-specified (https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).
  Hand-rolling ~40 LOC avoids pulling in ``prometheus_client`` (and its
  global default registry, which would fight with multi-engine tests).
- **No new runtime dependency.** Request outcome/token/timing series are
  produced by the scheduler's small in-memory performance ledger and are
  still exposed through ``engine.get_stats()``.
- **Unauthenticated**, on ``probe_router`` rather than the auth-gated
  router, to match the standard Prometheus scrape model. Mirrors
  ``/healthz`` exactly.

  The disclosure surface is intentional and matches industry convention
  (Linkerd, Envoy, nginx-prom-exporter, kubelet, etcd all expose /metrics
  without auth). The trust boundary is the network — operators are
  expected to put /metrics behind a private VIP, mTLS, or a sidecar
  proxy. Prometheus 2.x scrape configs *can* carry bearer tokens
  (``authorization`` section in ``scrape_config``), so this is a
  deliberate convention choice rather than a protocol limitation:
  matching the de-facto pattern keeps rapid-mlx interoperable with the
  large body of existing Prometheus tooling that assumes an unauth
  ``/metrics`` target.
- **Engine-not-loaded** is a 200, not a 500 — Prometheus would otherwise
  drop the entire target. Build info is always emitted.
- **Counter monotonicity** — the cache stats backing the
  ``rapid_mlx_prefix_cache_*_total`` series are reset to zero whenever
  the cache is cleared (admin-triggered via ``POST /cache/clear`` or
  internal recovery paths). Prometheus counters MUST be monotonically
  non-decreasing for ``rate()`` to work; otherwise ``rate()`` will spike
  to ``+Inf`` or go negative the scrape after a clear. The
  ``_StickyCounterAccumulator`` below snapshots the previous raw value
  on every scrape and folds resets into a baseline, so the exposed
  counter never decreases for the lifetime of the process.

class _StickyCounterAccumulator:
    """Make a resettable underlying counter look monotonic to Prometheus.

    The prefix/paged/memory-aware caches expose ``hits``/``misses``/
    ``evictions``/``tokens_saved`` that reset to zero on ``cache.clear()``
    (admin ``POST /cache/clear`` and a few internal recovery paths). If we
    forwarded those raw values to Prometheus they would decrement, and
    ``rate()`` would either spike to ``+Inf`` (overflow detection in
    Prometheus 2.x) or go negative for one scrape — both visibly wrong on
    dashboards.

    Strategy: on each ``advance(key, raw)`` call, compare ``raw`` to the
    previously-seen raw value for that ``key``. If ``raw < last_raw`` we
    assume the underlying source was reset (e.g. ``cache.clear()``) and
    fold the previously-exposed total into a baseline. The exposed value
    is always ``baseline + raw``, which is monotonic.

    Race notes (audit-relevant):
    - All state mutations happen under a single ``threading.Lock``. A
      concurrent scrape will see either the pre-advance or post-advance
      snapshot — never a torn baseline.
    - Reads use ``int`` so the bookkeeping is allocation-free per scrape.
    - The accumulator state is process-local. A process restart resets
      all counters to whatever the cache currently reports (matches every
      other Prometheus client library — ``process_start_time_seconds`` is
      how scrapers detect this).
