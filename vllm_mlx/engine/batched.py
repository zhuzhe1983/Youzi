Batched engine for continuous batching with multiple concurrent users.

This engine wraps AsyncEngineCore to provide continuous batching
for better throughput when serving multiple concurrent requests.

For MLLM models, all requests (text-only and multimodal) are routed through
the MLLMScheduler, which handles vision encoding and batched generation via
MLLMBatchGenerator. MLLM models only initialise the MLLM scheduler (not the
LLM engine), so text-only requests must also be routed through it.

    * Orphan-mutation risk on the shared mlx-step executor is a
      known tradeoff, explicitly accepted: the CLI's normal exit
      still tears down the interpreter (worker thread dies with
      it), and embedded / library callers own the tradeoff of
      keeping the interpreter alive past the abort.

        if the cap is reached, raises ``BackpressureError``; otherwise
        bumps the counter so a second concurrent caller sees the cap
        immediately. Closes the streaming race codex R2 flagged where
        two requests at ``cap-1`` could both pass a plain check-then-
        act gate and then have the loser raise ``BackpressureError``
        *inside* the response generator (which would degrade to a 200
        SSE error chunk instead of a clean HTTP 503).

        The reservation counter is authoritative for the cap — the
        scheduler's own ``len(requests) >= cap`` check in
        ``Scheduler.add_request`` is retained as defence in depth (a
        direct ``add_request`` caller that bypasses the engine would
        still hit it) but the route-handler path lives entirely on
        this counter, so a request never double-counts.

        The caller MUST call ``release_admission_reservation`` exactly
        once per successful ``check_admission`` — when the request is
        finished (response sent, generator closed, validation error,
        whatever). ``_disconnect_guard`` and ``_wait_with_disconnect``
        do this from a ``finally`` clause so route handlers don't have
        to thread it manually.

        """Create a per-request token router for supported tokenizer formats.

        Uses ``from_tokenizer_for_streaming`` so harmony models (gpt-oss)
        get routed through ``HarmonyStreamingRouter`` backed by
        openai-harmony's ``StreamableParser`` (issue #513). Falls back to
        the legacy custom state machine for non-harmony models and for
        harmony tokenizers whose IDs don't match the official encoding.

        Detection (``from_tokenizer_for_streaming`` →
        ``tokenizer.get_vocab()``) rebuilds the tokenizer's full vocab dict
        — ~60-85ms for a 262k-token Gemma vocab — and was previously paid on
        EVERY streaming request. The tokenizer and the harmony escape-hatch
        flags are fixed for the engine's lifetime, so the *detection result*
        (format + marker ``TokenMap``) is invariant; only the returned
        router's state machine is per-request. Memoize the detected
        ``(kind, TokenMap)`` once and rebuild a fresh, cheap router per
        request. This removes the entire ~84ms MLLM first-token overhead (the
        whole rapid-vs-mlx-vlm vision TTFT gap) and shaves the same
        per-request cost off every gemma-4 / gpt-oss streaming completion. The
        per-request router object is constructed exactly as before — this only
        skips re-scanning the vocab.
