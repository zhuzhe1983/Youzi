    additionally probe ``("127.0.0.1", port)``. Print a friendly error
    and ``sys.exit(1)`` on the first collision.

    Why both: macOS / Linux let a wildcard listener (``0.0.0.0`` or
    ``""``) coexist with a more-specific loopback listener
    (``127.0.0.1``) on the same port. v0.8.2 dogfood finding #2
    reproduced the resulting PortSweep bypass: ``nc -l 127.0.0.1 11812``
    + ``rapid-mlx serve --port 11812`` BOTH succeed, and
    ``curl 127.0.0.1:11812/healthz`` returns HTTP 000 (kernel routes
    loopback to nc, not rapid-mlx). The fix is to explicitly probe the
    loopback address whenever the requested bind is wider than loopback.

    MAJOR on PR #848 (the dogfood-CLI fix had to land on both supported
    entrypoints to actually close the bypass).

    ``::1`` is intentionally NOT probed when the user binds an IPv4
    wildcard: macOS treats v4 and v6 loopback as distinct stacks, and
    uvicorn's IPv4 bind never collides with an IPv6 listener. When the
    user EXPLICITLY binds an IPv6 host, we switch the probe family to
    ``AF_INET6`` so the bind doesn't spuriously fail (codex round-1

    ``serve_command`` reads the HF config on two paths — an early
    best-effort read that populates
    ``scheduler_config.mtp_model_type``, and a second read inside
    the MTP eligibility gate that decides accept/reject. Under a
    transient first-read failure (warm HF cache invalidated,
    filesystem hiccup, etc.), the first read returned ``None`` and
    the second read succeeded. The engine then treated the
    operator's explicit MTP speculative-config request as
    "non-CLI-vetted" and soft-skipped dispatch failures — silently
    degrading MTP to a no-op.

    This helper resolves the skew: it treats the eligibility gate's
    read as the source of truth (the gate accepted the config, so
    it MUST be correct), promotes ``model_type`` into
    ``scheduler_config.mtp_model_type``, and hard-fails at
    ``sys.exit(2)`` if the eligibility read somehow lacks a string
    ``model_type`` (should be unreachable per
    ``detect_mtp_eligibility``'s own gates, but defensive).

    Extracted so tests can drive this helper end-to-end. A
    purely-inline reconciliation block in ``serve_command`` would
    let tests still pass after the block was deleted, because
    replaying the logic inline in a test never exercises the
    production import path (round-K BLOCKING #2).

      scheduler_config: The already-constructed ``SchedulerConfig``.

        gate's ``_gather_kv_cache_dtype_inputs`` call.

        emitted when the CLI-thread read disagreed with the
        eligibility read. Kept optional so tests don't have to

    has rotated past its window (the front is overwritten, so a trim-then-
    continue would reconstruct wrong KV — see ``memory_cache`` ``_layer_forbids_
    trim``). Such a cache is non-trimmable but still REUSABLE at an exact token
    boundary, so these models need the bounded trim-free snapshot path — exactly
    like the recurrent-state families — or every agentic turn re-prefills the
    whole accumulated context (#2061).

    The signal is read straight off the checkpoint config so it is
    architecture-driven rather than a name list: it covers the whole sliding-
    window family, future additions, and bare local paths that resolve to no
    alias.

    The LANGUAGE backbone's attention config is authoritative — VLM checkpoints
    nest it under ``text_config``, so that is judged first and alone when it
    carries a signal (a top-level ``sliding_window`` scalar on such a checkpoint
    is often a vision/default value unrelated to the LM's attention). Within the
    chosen config, ``layer_types`` (Gemma-3/4's explicit per-layer attention
    kinds) is authoritative: a config listing only ``full_attention`` is NOT
    sliding even if it also carries a leftover ``sliding_window`` value (that
    field is inert without a sliding layer to apply it). A bare positive
    ``sliding_window`` is consulted only as the fallback for older configs that
    omit ``layer_types``. Only if the nested language config carries no signal
    at all does the top level get a look, for checkpoints that place attention

    """``rapid-mlx bench <model> --tier <T> --submit`` — PR #5 unification.

    Three-phase pipeline:

    1. Run the requested tier's smoke / harness work through the
       existing HTTP-server-backed dispatcher (``run_tier`` with
       ``return_results=True``). For ``tier='all'`` we pass
       ``skip_speed=True`` because phase 2 will produce the comparable
       speed numbers directly from the engine; running the lightweight
       HTTP-speed probe too would just double-cost the bench AND
       produce a second set of non-comparable numbers next to it.
       For ``tier='speed'`` phase 1 is a no-op — straight to phase 2.
    2. Run the locked B=1 ``run_standardized_bench`` against the same
       model so the schema-required ``buckets`` field carries the
       comparable numbers the community-benchmarks corpus expects.
       This phase IS what plain ``--submit`` (no ``--tier``) has
       always done; the tier kwargs just decorate the payload.
    3. Build the schema-v2 payload and run the standard interactive
       submit flow (consent → write → commit → push → gh pr create).

    Tier-failure handling: if phase 1's smoke probe FAILS, abort
    before phase 2 — there's no point benching a model that can't
    answer "what is 2+2?". A phase 1 harness failure does NOT abort:
    submitting a failure row IS the point of the harness tier (the
    aggregator wants visibility into "this combo doesn't pass the
    gauntlet"), so we proceed and let the payload carry the per-
    adapter failure flags.

def _dir_size_bytes(path: str) -> int:
    """Bytes of the distinct files under ``path``, each counted once.

    The HF cache keeps one copy of every model file under
    ``blobs/<sha>`` and references it from ``snapshots/<rev>/<file>``.
    Counting both sides tallies the same bytes twice, plus once more for
    every extra cached revision, so a 7.9 GB model was reported as
    15.9 GiB in ``ls --cached`` and in the macOS app's Settings → Models
    panel. That number is what tells a user how much disk deleting the
    model would free, so being 2x off is a lie — and it disagreed with
    ``rapid-mlx rm``, which gets its figure from
    ``huggingface_hub``'s own (correct) ``size_on_disk``.

    Two rules keep the count honest:

    * Only regular files are measured. Symlinks found during the walk
      are skipped, not followed: their bytes live somewhere else and a
      snapshot link is just a second name for a blob already counted.
      A dangling link therefore costs nothing and raises nothing, and
      a link cannot be descended into, so the walk neither loops nor
      leaves the tree it was pointed at.
    * Files are deduped by ``(st_dev, st_ino)``, so a hardlinked layout
      (``cp -al`` cache clones, restored CI caches, older hub versions)
      and a blob shared by several revisions each contribute once. When
      the hub genuinely *copies* a blob into a snapshot instead of
      linking it, the two copies have distinct inodes and are counted
      twice — which is right, because they really do occupy twice the
      disk.

    Deduping by identity rather than by the ``blobs``/``snapshots``
    directory names is deliberate: the name-based shortcut breaks on
    hardlinked caches and on directories holding several revisions.
    ``HFCacheByteMonitor.directoryByteCount`` in the macOS app takes the
    same approach via ``fileResourceIdentifierKey``, so the two agree on
    the same directory up to allocation granularity: this sums logical
    ``st_size``, the Swift side sums allocated blocks, so every file
    differs a little through block rounding and sparse or compressed
    files can differ a lot (model weights are neither). ``st_size`` is
    also the quantity ``huggingface_hub`` reports as
    ``CachedRepoInfo.size_on_disk``, which is what ``rapid-mlx rm``
    already prints — matching it makes the two surfaces agree.

    ``path`` itself is resolved through symlinks before the walk starts:
    it names the directory the caller wants measured, so a relocated
    cache entry reports its real contents rather than 0, which would be
    a fresh lie in the same column. Callers pass a
    ``models--<org>--<repo>`` cache root (or any plain directory of real
    files), never a bare ``snapshots/<rev>`` — that subtree owns no
    bytes of its own, and sizing one is ``_snapshot_size_bytes``' job.

    Missing or unreadable paths report 0 rather than raising: this feeds
    a listing, not a decision. For the same reason the walk is not
    hardened against another process swapping a subdirectory for a
    symlink between the moment it is queued and the moment it is
    scanned. Racing that window inflates a number in a table the user
    asked for about their own cache; anyone able to run it can rewrite
    the weights outright. Descriptor-relative traversal
    (``O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW`` plus ``dir_fd``) would close it and is
    not worth the fd bookkeeping here.

    ``register_in`` is an optional list (typically the chat REPL's

    *immediately* after construction — narrowing the SIGTERM-orphan race
    that exists between ``Popen()`` returning and the caller registering
    the handle. Caller-side ``register_in.append(proc)`` would still leave
    one Python statement of unprotected window; doing it inside this
    function closes that window for the caller.

    ``log_handle`` is the ``managed_tempfile_path`` context-manager handle
    that owns ``log_path``. When provided, ownership is transferred to the
    proc inside a SIGTERM/SIGINT-masked critical section that also performs
    the ``register_in`` append and the ``_rapid_mlx_log*`` attribute set.
    Without the mask + atomic transfer, a signal landing between
    ``_active_procs.append`` and the caller's later ``handle.release()``
    could fire ``_teardown_proc`` (which intentionally keeps non-empty
    logs for post-mortem) — then the ``with`` block's ``finally`` would
    unlink the kept log anyway, violating the keep-non-empty-log policy
    documented on ``_teardown_proc``. Codex round-1 BLOCKING #1.

    the spawned server exposes the alias as the API model name (e.g. user

    """Return True if the trailing ``window`` chars of ``text`` are
    periodic with a cycle length ≤``max_period``.

    Catches the degenerate-model cases the rolling whitespace-token
    counter in ``_stream_chat_response`` misses:

    - ``"BarleyBarleyBarley..."`` (no whitespace separator) — the entire
      suffix collapses to a single ``str.split()`` token whose count
      never increments. Real qwen3.5-4b-4bit regression surfaced in the
      0.6.28 onboarding test.
    - Long-cycle phrase loops, e.g. a ~280-char clause that repeats
      verbatim until ``max_tokens``. Surfaced when asked "describe the
      entire history of the Roman Empire in one long unbroken sentence".

    Implementation: compute the KMP failure function over the trailing
    window. The smallest period of the *entire* window is
    ``len(s) - fail[-1]``; a short period (≤``max_period``) means the
    window is dominated by that repetition starting from offset 0.

    Note: KMP itself does NOT detect periods that begin mid-window
    (rotated patterns). Mid-window degeneracy gets caught because this
    helper is invoked after every streaming chunk — once the model has
    been looping long enough to fill the window, the rolling 600-char
    suffix aligns with the pattern and the smallest-period check fires.
    A pure end-of-stream check would miss rotated cases.

    Cost is ``O(window)`` time and memory per call regardless of
    pattern length (the failure-function array is allocated each
    invocation) — much cheaper than the prior
    ``O(window * pattern_max_len)`` anchored scan, and cheap enough
    to run on every streaming chunk.

    The defaults (window=600, max_period=300) leave room for legitimate
    repetitive content like ``[0, 0, 0, ...]`` lists shorter than the
    window. *Long* lists of truly identical values the user explicitly
    asked for will get cut — a user hitting that false positive can
    ``/reset`` and rephrase. The cost of NOT cutting genuine model
    degeneracy (2000+ tokens of garbage) is far higher.

    the literal ``--`` verbatim to the ``rapid-mlx serve`` that ``share``

    keeps argparse's native behavior, including hard errors on unrecognized
    flags and native ``--`` end-of-options handling.

    Factored out of ``main`` so tests can drive the real parser + split with
