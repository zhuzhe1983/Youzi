"""Subprocess lifecycle helper for ``rapid-mlx serve`` during bench tier runs.

Previously lived at ``vllm_mlx/doctor/server.py``; PR #622 slimmed the
doctor module to pure env-health and deleted the file, but
``vllm_mlx/bench/tier_runner.py`` still imported it — so every actual
``rapid-mlx bench --tier ...`` invocation (which is exactly the path
that took over the model-validation work) crashed with
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vllm_mlx.doctor.server'``.

PR #5 (the --tier/--submit unification) moves the helper to the bench
package, which is the only consumer left in-tree. The implementation
is unchanged byte-for-byte from the original except:

- yields ``boot_time_ms`` in the info dict so the tier-smoke probe can
  populate ``smoke_result.boot_time_ms`` for the community-bench
  schema (PR #3 added that field; PR #5 wires the producer).
- ``REPO_ROOT`` / ``python_executable`` are imported from the same
  ``vllm_mlx.doctor.runner`` module that PR #622 kept around — no new
  duplication; if doctor.runner ever moves, both this module and the
  rest of the bench/ stack track it from one place.
