"""Single source of truth for per-model profile data.

Unifies the former ``AliasProfile`` (alias-keyed, resolved from
``aliases.json``) and ``ModelConfig`` (regex-detected, from
``model_auto_config``) into ONE frozen dataclass. Before this module the
two dataclasses mirrored a shared field set by hand, and
``detect_model_config`` copied a *subset* of ``AliasProfile``'s fields
into a fresh ``ModelConfig`` — so any field that existed on the alias
profile but was forgotten in that copy (``is_moe``, ``dflash_draft_model``,
``recommended_sampling``, ``modality``, ``ddtree_*``, ``min_memory_gb``)
silently never reached ``rapid-mlx info`` / serve defaults. Adding a field
meant editing two dataclasses AND the copy site; missing any one dropped
the field. Now there is exactly one class + one field set: add a field
here and every consumer sees it, with no copy step to drift out of sync.

``AliasProfile`` (in ``model_aliases``) and ``ModelConfig`` (in
``model_auto_config``) remain as module-level aliases of this class for
backward compatibility with the ~20 call sites that import them by name —
they are the *same* class, not two shapes.

Import-light on purpose: only stdlib + typing, so lightweight callers
(the CLI alias map, dflash / ddtree eligibility checks) can import the
profile shape without pulling in ``model_auto_config``'s regex detection
tables. Locating the class here (rather than in ``model_auto_config``)
also avoids an import cycle: ``model_auto_config`` already imports
``model_aliases.resolve_profile``, so the profile dataclass cannot live in
``model_auto_config`` without ``model_aliases`` importing it back.

# Ternary-Bonsai-27B — stays ``modality="text"`` and sets

class ModelProfile:
    """Per-model profile — parser defaults + capability gates.

    The single dataclass behind both ``AliasProfile`` (alias-keyed) and
    ``ModelConfig`` (regex-detected). Frozen so a resolved profile can be
    shared safely across threads and cached without a defensive copy.

    ``hf_path`` defaults to ``""`` so a regex-detected profile (no owning
    alias) can be constructed without one; alias construction always
    passes a validated non-empty path via ``model_aliases._coerce``.

    Construction is KEYWORD-ONLY (``kw_only=True``). This is deliberate
    and load-bearing for the unification: the pre-unification ``ModelConfig``
    began with ``tool_call_parser`` and carried no ``hf_path`` field at
    all, whereas the unified profile begins with ``hf_path``. Under
    positional construction a legacy call like ``ModelConfig("hermes")``
    would silently bind ``hf_path="hermes"`` instead of the intended
    ``tool_call_parser`` (pr_validate codex flagged exactly this on PR
    #1108). ``kw_only=True`` makes any positional construction a loud
    ``TypeError`` instead of a silent field-misbind, so the field-order
    difference between the two former dataclasses can never surface as a
    routing bug. Every construction site in-tree already passes keywords
    (``model_aliases._coerce``, the ``model_auto_config`` regex table,
    and all tests), so this is a no-op for existing callers.

    Migration paths for the two shape changes the unification introduced
    (both flagged by codex as needing an explicit deprecation path):
      * ``ModelConfig`` was mutable; a resolved profile is now frozen.
        Produce a modified copy with ``dataclasses.replace(profile,
        field=value)`` instead of ``profile.field = value``
        (``model_auto_config.enrich_model_config`` and
        ``engine_core`` already do this).
      * ``suffix_bench_speedup`` was a ``dict``; it is now a tuple of
        ``(workload, speedup)`` pairs (frozen dataclasses need immutable,
        hashable fields). Read it as a mapping via the ``speedup_dict``
        property, never ``profile.suffix_bench_speedup.get(...)``.

    Defaults err on the side of "supported" — known-incompatible families
    set the flag explicitly.
