"""Standardized B=1 benchmark for community submissions.

Locks every comparability parameter so a number submitted from one
user's machine can be compared 1:1 with a number submitted from
another's. The defaults mirror llama.cpp's ``llama-bench``
(``-p 512 -n 128 -r 5`` short; long bucket extends to pp=2048,
tg=512 for context-length sensitivity) because that's the de-facto
standard on r/LocalLLaMA / Apple Silicon discussion threads, so
Rapid-MLX numbers slot straight into existing comparison tables.

Hardcoded:

- 2 buckets: short (pp512, tg128) + long (pp2048, tg512)
- 5 measured rounds + 1 warmup discarded
- Greedy decode by default (temp=0, top_p=1) — the apples-to-apples
  baseline. ``sampling='sampled'`` provides the temp=0.7/top_p=0.9
  real-world line as a second, separately-bucketed submission.
- Synthetic random token prompt seeded by ``PROMPT_SEED`` so every
  submitter sends the exact same bytes through the model.
- Decode TPS formula: ``(output_tokens − 1) / (t_end − t_first_token)``,
  i.e. vLLM TPOT / llama.cpp ``tg`` semantics — the window measures
  inter-token gaps for tokens 2..N (the first token lands at
  ``t_first_token`` itself), so dividing by ``N`` instead of ``N − 1``
  would underreport TPS by N/(N−1). Excludes prefill so the number
  is the steady-state decoder speed, not a conflated end-to-end rate.
