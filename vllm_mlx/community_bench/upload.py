"""HTTP submission for community benchmarks.

Why this exists
---------------
``submit_interactive`` used to publish a run by committing a JSON file into
a checkout of Rapid-MLX and opening a pull request. That gated the whole
feature on two things a normal user does not have:

  1. the cwd being a git repository root, and
  2. a remote pointing at ``raullenchai/Rapid-MLX`` (or a fork + upstream)

Anyone who installed via ``pip install rapid-mlx`` or ``brew install
rapid-mlx`` has no checkout at all, so ``--submit`` exited before it ever
collected a number. That is the entire PyPI/Homebrew install base with no
path in — and it is why the corpus stalled in the low tens of rows.

This module replaces that with one POST. Standard library only: adding a
dependency to the submission path would be its own adoption tax.

Identity
--------
``install_id`` is a random 12-hex value minted once per install and kept in
``~/.rapid-mlx/bench-install-id``. It is used for the server's per-install
daily cap and so a contributor can find their own rows.

It is deliberately NOT derived from any hardware identifier. oMLX computes
its ``owner_hash`` from ``IOPlatformUUID``, which makes every public row
traceable to a specific machine; a random per-install value gives the same
rate-limiting and self-identification without that property. Deleting the
file resets it, which is the user's escape hatch.

It is also deliberately NOT the telemetry client id. Benchmark rows are
public and telemetry is not; sharing one identifier between them would let
anyone correlate a public board entry with a private telemetry stream.
