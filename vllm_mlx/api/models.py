# =============================================================================
# Shared sampling-parameter validators (F-011)
# =============================================================================
#
# Range validators of the form ``not (0 < x <= 2)`` are False for NaN
# because every comparison involving NaN returns False — so NaN slips
# past as "valid" and is then handed to the sampler / Metal kernels.
# Symptoms observed pre-fix on /v1/chat/completions and /v1/completions:
#
#   * ``temperature=NaN`` / ``top_p=NaN`` → HTTP 200 with
#     ``choices[0].message.content=null`` + ``usage=0,0,0``; the Metal
#     backend then aborts the command buffer with a GPU Timeout and the
#     server process dies. Silent burn from the client's POV.
#   * ``presence_penalty=±10`` / ``frequency_penalty=±10`` → HTTP 200
#     with mathematically undefined logit shifts (OpenAI spec caps both
#     at [-2, 2]).
#   * ``presence_penalty=inf`` / ``frequency_penalty=inf`` → HTTP 200,
#     same undefined-logit hazard.
#
# Fix shape: declare the OpenAI-spec range on the field itself (Field
# ge=/le=) so Pydantic emits a 422 for finite out-of-range values, and
# add a single ``field_validator`` that rejects NaN/inf. The
# field-level Field bounds skip NaN (same comparison semantics as the
# legacy in-route guard), so the finite check has to run separately —
# Pydantic v2 invokes both gates per field, and either one failing
# returns 422 with a clear "Input should be a finite number" / "Input
# should be less than or equal to N" message.
#
# Range is OpenAI-spec-faithful:
#   * temperature       : [0, 2]
#   * top_p             : (0, 1]   — 0 disables sampling (illegal)
#   * presence_penalty  : [-2, 2]
#   * frequency_penalty : [-2, 2]
#
# Defined as module-level helpers so both ChatCompletionRequest and
# CompletionRequest share the exact same logic — neither schema can
# drift away from the other.

    Contract:
      * ``None`` passes through unchanged (preserves default-None
        semantics so untouched fields don't trip the gate).

    """Reject bool / non-integer / negative values on ``seed`` (H-11 + r5-E B-8).

    OpenAI's spec documents ``seed`` as an integer; their Python SDK
    ships ``seed: Optional[int]`` with no documented range, but every
    real-world usage in their docs and examples uses non-negative
    integers (the canonical example is ``seed=12345``). The mlx-core
    backend key is a ``uint32``: a negative seed has no natural
    meaning in that space and ``-1`` is almost always a sentinel from a
    misbehaving SDK (Python ``random.randint(0, sys.maxsize)`` returning
    ``-1`` on overflow, ``np.int32(-1)`` from a probe). Accepting it
    silently and then bit-folding via ``& 0xFFFFFFFF`` maps ``-1`` →
    ``0xFFFFFFFF`` (a perfectly valid backend key) — which means the
    user thinks they passed a sentinel but actually pinned a fixed PRNG
    state. That mismatch is the exact silent-correctness hazard
    r5-E B-8 / cycle-DGF-V080-V2 surfaced; we close it with a 400.

    What we reject at the request layer:

      * ``bool`` — Pydantic v2 silently coerces ``True`` → 1 / ``False``
        → 0 on an ``int | None`` field, but ``seed=True`` is almost
        always a serialization mistake (same family as the ``n: true``
        footgun ``_reject_non_one_n`` already closes). A
        ``bool``-as-seed silent acceptance would mask client bugs.
      * Non-integer types — strings, floats, dicts. The OpenAI spec

# Optional generation-budget ceiling (M-04 — opt-in)
# =============================================================================
#
# Aanya (round-2 dogfooding) demonstrated that the F-007 body-bytes cap
# does not constrain ``max_tokens``: a small JSON body (e.g. 5K-token
# system prompt + ``max_tokens=10000``) sails through the body-size
# middleware because the wire bytes are well under the 8 MiB cap, yet
# the multi-tenant cost surface is determined by the *generation budget*
# the request claims, not the body size. A request asking for 10K
# output tokens on a model that costs $X/1K tokens is a cost vector
# regardless of how few bytes the request body weighs.
#
# This validator adds an OPT-IN ceiling on ``max_tokens`` so multi-tenant
# operators can cap the per-request generation budget without affecting
# single-machine ("Yuki posture") users who never set the env var.
#
# Contract:
#   * ``RAPID_MLX_MAX_GENERATION_TOKENS`` unset / blank / non-positive
#     → no enforcement. Identical behaviour to pre-fix; the body-bytes
#     cap remains the only generic DoS gate.
#   * ``RAPID_MLX_MAX_GENERATION_TOKENS=N`` with positive int N → reject
#     at parse time when ``max_tokens`` (after the
#     ``max_completion_tokens``/``max_tokens`` normalization on the
#     OpenAI side) exceeds N.
#
# Enforcement is intentionally narrow:
#   * Does NOT add a ``prompt_tokens + max_tokens <= context_window``
#     early-reject. Context window varies per model and that check
#     belongs in the engine (where the tokenizer is loaded). The cap
#     here is purely a *budget ceiling* — a hard policy lever an
#     operator can set without coupling to model state.
#   * Reads the env var at validator time (not module-import time) so
#     a test/operator can flip the ceiling without restarting the
#     process. Cost is one ``os.environ.get`` per request — negligible.

    declares ``schema_: dict``), the bare-``dict`` arm silently

        away the parser yields ``content=None`` and our callers serialize
        the response with ``model_dump_json(exclude_none=True)``; pydantic

        clients crash:

        * **Swift Codable**: ``decoder.container(keyedBy:)`` fails on
          missing required keys.
        * **Python pydantic** with ``extra="forbid"`` or ``content: str``
          on a strict response model.
        * **Rust serde**: a non-``Option`` field decode is a hard error.
        * **openai-python SDK**: ``resp.choices[0].message.content`` walks
          a Python dataclass that expects the key to be addressable.

        This wrap-mode serializer runs AFTER ``exclude_none`` pruning so
        we can put the field back regardless of how the parent was
        dumped.

        shape (``content: "" | string | null | array``), but ``""`` is
        what OpenAI's production API actually returns for the
        finish_reason="stop" + empty-completion case AND it preserves
        the wire-level ``string`` type discriminator so Swift Codable

        assistant messages now also serialize as

        had additionally surfaced a duplicate ``reasoning`` alias as a

        (``openai-agents`` ``Runner.run_streamed`` doubling every
        text_delta because the SDK walks both keys). The OpenAI

    surface a 400 with ``param="input"`` so callers can fix their
    request payload without an opaque 500 round-trip.

    ``input`` carries an explicit ``min_length=1``; the bound model is

    drop-in clients copied from pre-OAI-spec tutorials) actually get
    the codec they asked for. Pre-fix ``{"format":"mp3"}`` returned
    HTTP 200 with ``Content-Type: audio/wav`` and RIFF/WAVE bytes —
    the legacy key was silently dropped and ``response_format`` fell

        """R11-B-F2: fold the legacy ``format`` key into ``response_format``.

        Some OpenAI-compatible clients (early ``openai-python`` releases,
        Anthropic sample code, drop-in tutorials copied before the spec
        was tightened) send ``{"format":"mp3"}`` instead of
        ``{"response_format":"mp3"}``. Pre-fix the key was silently
        dropped and ``response_format`` defaulted to ``"wav"`` —
        callers got HTTP 200 with RIFF/WAVE bytes mislabeled as the
        requested codec.

        Resolution rules (in order):

        * If ``response_format`` is explicitly set by the caller →
          keep it; the legacy ``format`` key is ignored (with a debug
          log) so the explicit, spec-correct field always wins. Never
          a silent override of caller intent.
        * Else if ``format`` is present and a string → fold it into
          ``response_format`` so the downstream field-validator
          enforces the allowed-set contract on the same value.
        * Else → leave the payload untouched (``response_format``
          falls back to its ``"wav"`` default).

        We do NOT remove the ``format`` key from the payload — Pydantic's
        ``extra="ignore"`` (the model default) drops it before field
        binding, so leaving it in place is harmless and keeps this
        validator side-effect-free if a future refactor changes the

        OpenAI streaming SDK reduces deltas into a final-state
        message (the canonical ``ChatCompletion`` aggregator pattern),
        the resulting ``message.content`` is a string, not a
        sometimes-None sometimes-string union — so strongly-typed
        Swift / Rust clients decoding the aggregated message keep
        their happy path.

        r10-B R10-C2 — emit ONLY ``reasoning_content`` on the wire.
        r7-A R7-H2 had also emitted a duplicate ``reasoning`` alias
        as a one-release deprecation window; that window is now
        closed. The duplicate was the byte-for-byte root cause of
        R9-CRIT3 (``openai-agents`` ``Runner.run_streamed`` emitting
        every text_delta twice because the SDK walks both keys).
        The OpenAI o1-style streaming spec uses ``reasoning_content``
        only — there is no ``reasoning`` key on chat-completion deltas.
