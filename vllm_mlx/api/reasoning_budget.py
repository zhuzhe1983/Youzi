"""Generation-time thinking-token budget (force-close ``</think>``).

A reasoning model emits ``<think>…</think>`` before its answer. Without a
budget it can think for an unbounded number of tokens (burning compute and
latency) before committing. This module enforces a per-request *thinking*
budget AT DECODE TIME: once the model has spent ``max_think_tokens`` inside the
thinking span, the next-token logits are OVERRIDDEN so the ONLY sampleable token
is the single ``</think>`` id — the model is forced to close the block and move
on to its answer. This is a real generation-time control, not the post-hoc
reasoning-text trim in :mod:`vllm_mlx.service.postprocessor` (which lets the
model keep generating and only relabels/injects the close marker in the OUTPUT
the client sees).

Three mature engines converge on exactly this mechanism, and we copy their
shape rather than invent one:

* **SGLang** ``ReasonerGrammarObject`` (``constrained/reasoner_grammar_backend.py``):
  a THINKING→GENERATION state machine; the instant ``tokens_in_think`` reaches
  the budget it rewrites the vocab mask to allow ONLY ``think_end_id``.
* **vLLM** ``ThinkingBudgetStateHolder`` (``v1/sample/thinking_budget_state.py``):
  fills the forced end-token logit to a DOMINATING value once the budget is
  exhausted (an override, not a nudge).
* **mlx-vlm** ``ThinkingBudgetCriteria`` (``mlx_vlm/utils.py``): resolves the
  end token by id (``tokenizer.encode(...)[-1]``), counts only inside the span,
  forces the close sequence.

All three: identify ``</think>`` by TOKEN ID (not string), count only tokens
inside the thinking span, treat ``budget < 0`` as unlimited, and force by making
the end token the sole choice. We express that force as an mlx-lm logits
processor so it drops into the existing per-step decode loop (the same slot the
``GrammarLogitsProcessor`` uses) with no decode-loop changes.

    """Force ``</think>`` once a per-request thinking-token budget is spent.

    mlx-lm contract: called every decode step as ``processor(token_ids,
    logits) -> logits`` where ``token_ids`` is the FULL cumulative sequence
    (prompt + everything generated so far). We baseline past the prompt on the
    first call and commit only the newly generated tail each step (O(new
    tokens), never O(n) — mirrors :class:`GrammarLogitsProcessor`), so the hot
    loop stays linear.

    Phase machine (mirrors SGLang ``ReasonerGrammarObject``):

    * THINKING — from the start of generation (when ``seeded_thinking``, i.e.
      the prompt prefilled ``<think>``) or from the first ``think_start_id`` in
      the generated span, until ``think_end_id`` is emitted. Every generated
      token in this span counts toward the budget, with two exemptions: the ONE
      opener that BEGINS the span is free (a seeded ``<think>`` never reaches the
      generated tail; an emitted opener transitions the machine in without being
      counted) and ``think_end_id`` is free. A ``think_start_id`` REPEATED while
      already thinking is NOT exempt — it counts, else a model looping ``<think>``
      could stall the budget forever (see ``_commit_tail``). At budget, force
      ``think_end_id``.
    * GENERATION — once ``think_end_id`` is seen, the processor suppresses a
      later ``think_start_id`` while leaving every other logit unchanged. This
      prevents a bounded reasoning turn from reopening hidden reasoning after
      public content, which the Responses protocol cannot represent. A cached
      one-token mask keeps this O(1) after the boundary.

    ``seeded_thinking`` selects between the TWO shapes a reasoning template can
    take: one that PREFILLS ``<think>`` into the prompt (seeded — the opener
    never appears in the generated tail, so counting starts at the first
    generated token) AND one whose model EMITS ``<think>`` as a generated token
    (not seeded — counting begins only AFTER that opener, and ``think_start_id``
    identifies it). The caller derives which shape applies from the TEMPLATE'S
    rendered generation prefix (``rendered_prompt_opens_think``), never from raw
    conversation content, so a ``<think>`` a user typed cannot mis-seed the
    budget. Either way the opener token is free, so a ``budget == 0`` request
    closes to a well-formed ``<think></think>`` rather than an unmatched
    ``</think>``.

    A request whose thinking is not enabled (``seeded_thinking`` false and no
    ``think_start_id`` ever appears) is never force-closed — the budget cannot
    fire on a non-thinking request (guards the vLLM #39130 footgun: never wait
    on / force a reasoning end that cannot occur).

    trips the stop matcher and generation halts AT the reasoning boundary — the
    whole budget is spent on thinking and the ANSWER is never produced (codex).
    A model's reasoning end is a template-internal boundary, not a user stop; to
    keep that invariant on this degenerate config we DECLINE the generation-time
    budget and keep the post-hoc cap, which appends ``</think>`` to the FINAL
    text WITHOUT passing it through the decode-time stop matcher, so the answer
    still generates. Mirrors the tools / thinking-off opt-outs.

    We flag ANY stop the forced ``</think>`` can PARTICIPATE in matching — the
    forced token sits between the last reasoning tokens and the first answer
    tokens (``…R</think>A…``), and R/A are arbitrary model output, so the stop
    can be completed across EITHER boundary (codex R13: an earlier revision only
    checked the marker-prefix boundary and wrongly let ``x</think>y`` /
    ``</think>A`` through — the trailing text is supplied by the ANSWER tokens
    that follow the forced close, so those DO fire and truncate the answer).
    Over-declining is safe (falls back to the post-hoc cap, which still enforces
    the budget); only genuinely independent stops (``<|im_end|>``, ``\\n\\n``)
    stay on the decode-time path.
