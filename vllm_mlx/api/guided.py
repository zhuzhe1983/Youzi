Guided generation for structured JSON output using llguidance.

This module provides constrained decoding for JSON schema enforcement,
ensuring model outputs strictly adhere to specified schemas.

Backend
-------
The constraint engine is `llguidance <https://github.com/guidance-ai/llguidance>`_,
driving an ``mlx_lm`` decode loop. On every step llguidance computes a
token bitmask for the current grammar state and its native ``llguidance.mlx``
Metal kernel writes ``-inf`` into the logits of every disallowed token
before sampling. This replaces the former ``outlines``-backed path; the
public surface (``GuidedGenerator``, ``generate_with_schema``,
``is_guided_available``, ``json_schema_to_pydantic``) is unchanged.

Two constraint modes are supported, matching the two the OpenAI
``response_format`` route exposes today:

* ``generate_json``        — a full JSON Schema (``$defs``/``$ref``/
  ``anyOf``/``enum``/numeric bounds/``additionalProperties:false``/nested
  objects all interpreted natively by llguidance).
* ``generate_json_object`` — any syntactically valid JSON *object* (the
  ``response_format={"type":"json_object"}`` mode).

# ``GuidedSchemaCompileError`` originally lived in THIS module; it now lives in
# the dependency-free ``errors`` module (so the app-startup exception handler
# and route modules can reference it without triggering native MLX / llguidance
# init). Re-imported here — it is both used below (``_decode_constrained``
# raises it) and kept importable as ``vllm_mlx.api.guided.GuidedSchemaCompileError``
# for backward compatibility. The 400-envelope builder and the param-stamp
# helper live in ``errors`` and are imported directly from there by consumers.
#
# NOTE: deliberately NO ``__all__`` — this module has long exported its public
# names (``GuidedGenerator``, ``generate_with_schema``, ``is_guided_available``,
# ``json_schema_to_pydantic``, ``LLMatcher`` …) implicitly via
# ``from vllm_mlx.api.guided import *``. Adding an ``__all__`` would silently
# hide every name not listed, breaking existing ``import *`` consumers; leaving
# it off keeps all module-level public names exported.

        """Run an ``mlx_lm`` decode loop constrained by an llguidance grammar.

        Incremental generation MIRRORS ``mlx_lm``'s supported decode path
        (``mlx_lm.generate.generate_step``): a per-request KV cache built
        with ``mlx_lm.models.cache.make_prompt_cache(model)`` is threaded
        through *every* model call via the ``cache=`` kwarg. The prompt is
        prefilled WITH the cache, and each subsequent step feeds only the
        single new token — the cache carries the prompt + all prior tokens
        forward, so the model keeps full context instead of seeing one bare
        token in isolation. This matches how rapid-mlx's own engine threads
        the cache (e.g. ``mllm_batch_generator`` / ``engine/batched``):
        ``make_prompt_cache(model)`` then ``model(ids, cache=cache)``.

        Prefill is CHUNKED, not single-call. Feeding the whole prompt in one
        ``model(prompt[None], cache=cache)`` forward pass materializes
        sequence-wide activations and OOMs on long production prompts (e.g.
        structured extraction over a long document). We therefore port the
        exact chunking loop from ``mlx_lm.generate.generate_step`` (mlx-lm
        0.31.3, ``generate.py`` lines 424-453): process the prompt in
        ``_PREFILL_STEP_SIZE`` (2048, mlx-lm's default) token chunks,
        ``mx.eval`` the cache state and ``mx.clear_cache()`` between chunks
        to bound peak memory, and leave the trailing (< step size) remainder
        to produce the first constrained sample's last-token logits.

        Threading note: guided generation runs on the model-owning executor
        thread and the mask kernel shares that thread's default stream, so
        we do NOT introduce ``mx.new_stream``. The cache is per-call local
        state — no cross-thread sharing.

        On every step:
          1. ``fill_next_token_bitmask`` computes the allow-mask for the
             matcher's current state.
          2. Logits are sliced to ``lltok.vocab_size`` (the model's logit
             width can exceed the tokenizer vocab — the padding tail is
             never a real token) and the native ``apply_token_bitmask``
             Metal kernel writes ``-inf`` into disallowed positions.
          3. The next token is chosen (greedy at ``temperature<=0``, else
             temperature sampling) and fed back into the matcher.
          4. The model is advanced by that one token, appending its KV into
             the same cache.

        Returns the decoded text ONLY when the grammar reached an accepting
        (fully-satisfied) state; ``None`` otherwise — i.e. if the tokenizer
        was unavailable, generation was truncated by ``max_tokens``
        mid-object, or a token was rejected mid-parse. An incomplete result is
        never returned to the caller, which treats ``None`` as an OPERATIONAL
        guided failure: under strict mode the route surfaces a sanitized 502
        ``strict_schema_violation`` (a server-side inability to honor the
        constraint), and under non-strict mode it degrades to a best-effort
        unconstrained 200.

        Raises ``GuidedSchemaCompileError`` when llguidance rejects the grammar
        at matcher construction. ``generate_json`` CATCHES it and degrades to
        ``None`` — the SAME operational path as above (strict 502 / non-strict
        best-effort 200), NOT a 400: the structural validity of the caller
        schema is already settled UPSTREAM at the route boundary, so a rejection
        that reaches this layer is an operational llguidance failure on an
        already-valid schema, not a caller fault. The dedicated exception type
        is retained only so the rejection is distinguishable in logs from a
        benign truncated-parse ``None``.

        The raw schema dict is compiled by llguidance via
        ``LLMatcher.grammar_from_json_schema``, which natively understands
        ``$defs``, ``$ref``, ``anyOf``, ``enum``, numeric bounds,
        ``additionalProperties: false``, and nested objects. We compile
        with ``overrides={"whitespace_flexible": True}`` (llguidance's
        default) so structural whitespace is OPTIONAL, not forbidden.

        Whitespace flexibility is a correctness requirement, not cosmetic.
        With ``whitespace_flexible: False`` the grammar forbids the space
        after ``:`` / ``,`` — but a chat-tuned model's natural top token
        after ``"answer":`` is the SPACE-prefixed string opener (`` "``).
        Masking that token forces greedy decoding onto the next-best
        allowed token, which on real models derails an UNBOUNDED string
        field into fluent-but-wrong content (observed: ``"answer"`` became a
        fabricated URL instead of ``"Paris"``). Permitting the space keeps
        the model on its true distribution, so the answer stays coherent.
        Downstream validation is whitespace-agnostic (it ``json.loads`` then
        ``jsonschema.validate``), and the route re-serialises via
        ``json.dumps``, so the extra structural whitespace never reaches the
        client — the parsed object is identical.

        We deliberately do NOT route the schema through
        ``json_schema_to_pydantic`` first — that shallow converter silently
        drops every one of those constructs, which on a real-world schema
        with ``$defs`` + ``$ref`` (waybarrios#546 repro) surfaced as a
        valid JSON *array* where the schema required an object. The dict is
        handed to llguidance directly.
