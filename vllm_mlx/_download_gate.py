"""Auto-pull confirmation gate for large model downloads.

Persona-3 ("Ollama switcher") feedback (2026-05): running

    rapid-mlx chat qwen3-coder-4bit

against an alias that wasn't yet cached silently kicked off a 41.8 GB
download with no ``[Y/n]`` prompt. The download itself ran fine, but
because the spawned ``serve`` subprocess captured stdout to a logfile,
the user saw a blank screen and assumed the CLI was hung.

This module is the user-visible safety net. It is intentionally
self-contained at MODULE level (no rapid-mlx imports) so it stays cheap
to import from ``cli.main()`` on every invocation. The two subfolder
helpers below reach into ``model_aliases`` through function-local
imports, which preserves that property — the registry is only read on
the paths that already touch the filesystem or the Hub.

Public API:

* :func:`estimate_repo_size_bytes` — best-effort HF API size lookup.
* :func:`estimate_download_size_bytes` — live estimate with a checked-in
  manifest fallback for the confirmation gate.
* :func:`confirm_or_abort`         — prompt + abort path used by the CLI.
* :func:`is_repo_cached`           — cache-presence probe (so callers can
  short-circuit without re-implementing the path dance).

Design choices:

* The HF call is wrapped in a hard 5-second timeout and a blanket
  ``except Exception`` — a flaky metadata query must never block a
  perfectly-good cached load, and we already gate on cache presence
  upstream of the size estimate.
* The threshold defaults to 10 GiB. Anything under that is too small
  to warrant interrupting the user's flow.
* The env override (``RAPID_MLX_AUTO_PULL=1``) is the documented escape
  hatch for non-interactive CI usage and ``--yes``-style workflows.
* Non-TTY stdin → auto-confirm. Scripts that pipe input into
  ``rapid-mlx`` must not deadlock on a missing terminal.

    ``<etag>.<8 hex>.incomplete`` and unlinks it in a ``finally``. The unique
    name is deliberate upstream (a shared name corrupts the cache on filesystems
    where ``flock`` silently succeeds for every caller), but it means an
    interrupted attempt is never resumed — and a process killed by a signal
    never runs that ``finally``. The desktop cancels a download with SIGTERM and
    then SIGKILL, so every cancel, quit or crash strands one file per blob that
    was in flight, and nothing in the cache ever reclaims them. Measured on a

    are possible (a background ``pull`` on the mirror path alongside a ``serve``
    falling back to HF), and while unlinking a file another process holds open
    does not corrupt anything on POSIX — the writer keeps its descriptor and

    Originally factored to mirror ``vllm_mlx.doctor.discovery``;
    rounds 4-6 of the codex review tightened this path beyond doctor's.
    The two now have *intentionally* different policies (Codex round-6
    NIT #3 on convergence):
      * Doctor cares "is there a model directory I could try to run?"
        and accepts a single safetensors / npz / gguf as a hint.
      * B2 gate cares "will mlx_lm.load successfully open this without
        downloading more shards?" — answerable only by mirroring the
        actual loader glob (``model*.safetensors``, case-sensitive).
    Unifying would loosen B2 or tighten doctor; both are wrong.

    Strategy:
      1. ``model.safetensors.index.json`` present → parse ``weight_map``
         and require every referenced shard to exist with non-zero
         size. Primary ``model*.safetensors`` shards must stay at the root
         consumed by mlx-lm; safe nested paths are accepted for declared
         auxiliary weights.
      2. Without an index, numbered ``model-N-of-M`` files must form the
         complete 1...M set. This covers an interrupted pull where one shard
         lands before the index file.
      3. Otherwise, a single non-empty ``model*.safetensors`` is sufficient
         (covers single-file non-sharded models).

    Index-but-no-shards (Codex round-5 BLOCKING #1): when an

    NOT fall back to the single-file probe. The presence of the index

    Video-gen repos don't lay their weights out the way the text loader
    expects: they ship one ``<component>.safetensors`` per component at the
    snapshot root (CogVideoX-Fun → ``transformer`` / ``text_encoder`` / ``vae``;
    LTX-2.3 → ``transformer`` / ``connector`` / ``vae_decoder`` / ``vocoder`` /
    …), never a ``model*.safetensors``. ``is_repo_cached`` therefore reads a
    fully-cached video model as *weightless*, which would make
    :func:`is_weightless_stub` cry wolf ("config cached, weights missing —
    will download ~N GB") on every serve of an already-downloaded video model.

    Completeness, not mere presence (codex BLOCKING): we DON'T infer "non-text,
    weighted" from the presence of any stray ``.safetensors`` — that would
    misread (a) an interrupted multimodal *text* download whose vision tower
    landed before its shards, or (b) an interrupted *video* pull that has only
    one of its components. Instead we anchor on ``split_model.json`` — the
    mlx-video manifest that positively identifies the layout AND enumerates the
    exact component list — and require EVERY ``<component>.safetensors`` to be
    present and non-empty, exactly as :func:`_snapshot_is_complete` walks the
    text ``weight_map``. A text LLM never ships ``split_model.json``, so an
    incomplete text cache always falls through to :func:`is_repo_cached`; a
    partial video cache fails a component check and also falls through.

    ``model_index.json`` (bare diffusers pipeline manifest) is intentionally
    NOT accepted on its own: it names components but not their on-disk weight
    filenames (flat file vs ``component/`` subdir vs sharded — packaging
    dependent), so it can't be completeness-checked reliably here. Both rapid-
    mlx video families (CogVideoX-Fun, LTX-2.3) ship ``split_model.json``; a
    hypothetical manifest-less / index-only repo simply falls back to the
    (cosmetic) false alarm rather than risking a wrong suppression.

    Mirrors :func:`is_repo_cached`'s snapshot resolution (``refs/main`` →
    pinned sha) so both read the same on-disk snapshot. Returns ``False`` on
    any internal error so the caller defaults to the existing text-glob path.

    Wan video repos (``video/wan.py``'s ``WAN_REVISIONS``) are pinned to an
    exact commit sha, so ``snapshot_download(repo, revision=<sha>)`` caches
    under ``snapshots/<sha>`` WITHOUT advancing ``refs/main`` (exactly the
    ``IMAGE_MODEL_REVISIONS`` mflux case). The generic probes miss this warm
    cache: ``is_repo_cached`` resolves via ``refs/main``;
    :func:`_snapshot_is_complete_split_model` requires a ``split_model.json``
    manifest (Wan checkpoints ship none); :func:`_snapshot_is_complete_mflux_model`
    is image-gen-only. Without this, a warm-cached Wan snapshot reads as
    *weightless* / non-runnable and would re-download on every start.

    Deterministic, verified-filename-only completeness mirroring what
    ``mlx_video.models.wan_2.generate`` loads from ``model_dir``. The pinned
    checkpoints share the common encoder + VAE files (``config.json``,
    ``t5_encoder.safetensors``, ``vae.safetensors``); the diffusion transformer
    layout is **family-exact**, not inferred from whichever files happen to be
    present: the 5B checkpoints ship a single ``model.safetensors``, the A14B
    checkpoints ship ``high_noise_model.safetensors`` AND
    ``low_noise_model.safetensors``. A repo whose id does not indicate a known
    family (5B / A14B) fails closed rather than guessing, so an incomplete A14B
    snapshot with a stray ``model.safetensors`` is never accepted. No
    speculative generic ``*.safetensors``: an unrelated stray weight must not
    make the snapshot look runnable.

    Every file must be present, non-empty, and resolve **strictly inside the
    repo's own ``blobs`` directory** (HF snapshot leaves symlink into
    ``blobs/<etag>``). Requiring under ``blobs`` — not merely under the repo
    root — stops a snapshot from borrowing files from a sibling snapshot via a
    crafted symlink.
