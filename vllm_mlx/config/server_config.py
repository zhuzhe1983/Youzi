# — ``vllm_mlx.engine`` eagerly imported ``engine_core``, which does
# ``import mlx.core`` at module scope — so naming ``BaseEngine`` here made
# ``vllm_mlx.config`` unimportable anywhere MLX is absent, and a wire
# adapter that consults ``get_config()`` died on Linux CI.
#
# The fix is in ``vllm_mlx/engine/__init__.py``, which now imports only the
# stdlib-pure ``base`` eagerly and defers the MLX-dependent members to PEP
# 562. Hiding this behind ``TYPE_CHECKING`` instead would have left
# ``typing.get_type_hints(ServerConfig)`` unable to resolve the name, and a
# runtime stand-in would have made it answer with the wrong type; keeping
# the import real and cheap is correct for the runtime and the type checker
# at once.
