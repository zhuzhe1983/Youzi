"""Diffusion lane — discrete text-diffusion inference engine.

Wraps mlx-vlm 0.6.3's ``stream_diffusion_generate`` so DiffusionGemma
(and any future block-diffusion text model in the same family) can ride
the same ``BaseEngine`` contract as ``BatchedEngine`` does for AR LLMs.

Why a separate engine — not a path inside ``BatchedEngine``
-----------------------------------------------------------
DiffusionGemma denoises a fixed-size canvas (default 256 tokens) for K
steps and emits the whole block at once, then slides the window. This
is incompatible with the auto-regressive scheduler in three ways:

  * No per-token logits stream — emission is block-granular.
  * No KV cache mutation per token — the canvas is overwritten in
    place.
  * Spec-decode + DFlash are silently meaningless (no draft tokens to
    verify when the whole block lands at once).

So we route at the ``modality`` boundary in ``server.load_model``: a
``modality="text-diffusion"`` alias instantiates ``DiffusionEngine``
here instead of ``BatchedEngine``. Everything downstream of the
``_engine`` slot in ``server.py`` is blind to the difference because
``DiffusionEngine`` implements the same ``BaseEngine`` interface.

Dependency
----------
mlx-vlm >= 0.6.3, which contains Blaizzy/mlx-vlm#1347 (Gemma 4 DLM
model files) and #1348 (long-context prefill fix). Verified locally
2026-06-10. The pyproject pin floor is bumped to ``>=0.6.3`` so a
fresh ``pip install rapid-mlx`` lands a build that has the
``mlx_vlm.models.diffusion_gemma`` package on disk.

#
# Empirically (15-prompt quality probe on diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-4bit,
# 2026-06-11) the leak fires when a prompt asks the model to show its

# the entire response inside it without ever opening a ``final`` channel.
# Older one-shot cases also leaked the prefix on translation tasks.
#
# This regex strips a leading ``thought\n`` or ``final\n`` channel
# header from the FIRST non-empty block emitted per request. Mid-stream
# channel switches (model alternates ``thought`` → ``final`` in one
# response) are rare in this model and would require a stateful

    ``stream_diffusion_generate`` to leak GBs of process RSS per
    request after request ~22 (issue #698, RCA finalised here).

    Root cause (Blaizzy/mlx-vlm upstream, vendored at
    ``site-packages/mlx_vlm/utils.py``):

      * ``load_processor`` constructs a ``StoppingCriteria`` from
        ``tokenizer.eos_token_id``. ``StoppingCriteria.__init__``
        STORES the list by reference, not by copy
        (utils.py:1890 ``self.eos_token_ids = eos_token_ids``).
      * ``model.config.generation_config["eos_token_id"]`` is the
        SAME list object that ``tokenizer.eos_token_id`` was built
        from (HuggingFace loader path), so we end up with a triple
        alias:
            stopping_criteria.eos_token_ids
            is generation_config["eos_token_id"]
            is tokenizer.eos_token_id     # for some checkpoints
      * Every call to ``stream_diffusion_generate`` does
        ``tokenizer.stopping_criteria.add_eos_token_ids(
        generation_config["eos_token_id"])`` (diffusion.py:615).
      * ``add_eos_token_ids`` extends ``self.eos_token_ids`` with
        the items in ``new_eos_token_ids`` — but the two are the
        SAME list, so it extends a list with itself, doubling its
        length on every request.

    We measured this directly: ``len(eos_token_ids)`` goes
    3 → 6 → 12 → 24 → 48 … on the first 4 calls. After 22 requests
    the list crosses 12 M ints (~3 GB Python heap), which is
    exactly the +200, +500, +700, +1500, +3800 MB / request
    explosion we see in the in-process probe AND in the production
    soak. ``mx.metal.get_active_memory()`` stays flat the whole
    time — the leak is pure Python heap, which is why
    ``gc.collect()`` and ``mx.clear_cache()`` made zero difference
    (the list is reachable; no cycle to break).

    Fix: copy both lists once, at engine-load time. Aliasing is
    now broken — subsequent ``add_eos_token_ids(generation_config
    ["eos_token_id"])`` calls extend our private list with the
    items of the (also now-private) generation_config list, so the
    growth becomes linear at ~3 ints/request (~24 KB after 1000
    requests, indistinguishable from noise) instead of doubling.

    An upstream fix should land in mlx-vlm itself (change line
    1890 to ``self.eos_token_ids = list(eos_token_ids)``); when
    rapid-mlx's mlx-vlm floor moves past the fixed release this
    workaround can be deleted.

        to strip special tokens from the detokenized canvas.

        Starts from ``tokenizer.all_special_ids`` (the conservative
        default — strip everything the tokenizer flagged as special).
        When the alias declares a tool-call parser this engine knows
        how to surface (see ``_TOOL_PARSER_MARKERS``) AND the active
        request actually attached tools (``has_tools=True``), drops
        the parser's wire markers from the skip set so they survive
        detokenization and reach the post-generation parser in
        ``routes/chat.py``. Without the carve-out, mlx-vlm would
        strip the markers, the parser would see plain prose, and the
        tool request would silently degrade.

        ``has_tools=False`` (the default) keeps the markers in the
        skip set. This is the path plain non-tool chats take: the
        parser never runs on the response (routes/chat.py only
        invokes it when ``request.tools`` is set), so any
        spontaneously-emitted marker token would otherwise leak raw
        wire-format characters into the client's content stream
        (codex r2 BLOCKING #1).

        Carve-out is strictly subtractive — only ids the tokenizer
        encodes a marker into as a single token AND that are already
        in the skip set get removed. Tokenizers that decompose a
        marker into multiple ids (e.g. a future model whose template
        spells ``<|tool_call>`` as a 3-token sequence) keep their
        existing skip behaviour because the parser still sees the
        literal characters via cross-token detokenization.

        Pure helper — no I/O, no side effects beyond constructing
        the return set. Exposed at instance scope so unit tests can
        exercise the carve-out without standing up a worker thread
        or invoking the mlx-vlm diffusion generator.
