        local-cache metadata), and the reservation is committed only on
        success or rolled back on failure/cancellation so no leaked
        reservation desyncs the ledger.

        ``replace_existing=True`` charges the new footprint against the old
        role's reservation (crediting the previous bytes) and, on rollback,
        restores the previous reservation unless the caller retired it via
        :meth:`ResidentRoleAdmission.retire_previous`.

        ``release_exclusive_role`` adds a SECOND mutually-exclusive auxiliary
        role to the same transaction (e.g. alignment retiring the dictation
        ``speech-input`` role whose ASR engine the aligner evicts). The
        sibling's reservation is RETAINED in ``self._roles`` — the real
        auxiliary ledger, never the ``snapshot()`` projection — for the whole
        transaction and its bytes are CREDITED against the new role's admission,
        so the two are never double-charged (no false 507) yet no concurrent
        admission can consume the sibling's capacity (no steal window). The new
        role's admission and the sibling's retention happen under the SAME
        ``self._lock`` critical section. On success (commit) — including a load
        that finished under cancellation — the sibling is retired when the
        aligner evicts its engine. On failure/cancellation the sibling stays in
        the ledger (matching its still-resident engine) unless the load evicted
        it first, in which case the caller's
        :meth:`ResidentRoleAdmission.retire_exclusive` signal drops the now
        phantom reservation. A still-resident engine is never left unaccounted,
