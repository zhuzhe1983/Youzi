"""MLX-native image generation engine.

Unified adapter over mflux and the pinned native MLX runtimes used by image
families outside mflux. Rapid-MLX owns request validation, the lazy-load /
process-lock lifecycle, checkpoint boundaries, and the OpenAI-compatible
transport; each family backend owns its diffusion pipeline and weight loading.

Each wired family has an explicit runtime and model-license contract. Some
checkpoints are permissive; others require the user to accept model-specific
terms before commercial use:

* ``flux2-klein``      — text→image + image edit (``FLUX.2-klein-4B``),
  4B/4-step, the fast default: ~3 s @ 512² / ~10 s @ 1024² on an M3 Ultra,
  ~4 GB at 4-bit
* ``z-image``          — text→image (``Z-Image-Turbo``), 6B/8-step, the quality
  option (SOTA open-source photorealism), ~5.5 GB at 4-bit
* ``flux-schnell``     — text→image (``black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell``), 12B
* ``qwen-image``       — text→image (``Qwen/Qwen-Image``), strongest text-in-image
* ``qwen-image-edit``  — instruction edit (``Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509``)
* ``hidream-o1-dev``   — text→image (``HiDream-O1-Image-Dev``), 28-step,
  VAE-free unified pixel transformer (MIT)
* ``sdxl-base``        — text→image (``Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0``),
  30-step, dual-CLIP + UNet + VAE pipeline (OpenRAIL++)
* ``bonsai-image``     — text→image (ternary ``FLUX.2-klein-4B``), 4-step,
  prepacked MLX 2-bit transformer with a 4-bit Qwen3 encoder (Apache-2.0)
* ``sd35-large``       — text→image (``Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large``), 28-step,
  triple-encoder MMDiT pipeline (Stability AI Community License)

``flux2-klein`` and ``z-image`` supersede the older/larger families for the
interactive tab: Klein is ~3× faster than schnell/z-image at the same
resolution while staying smaller, and Qwen-Image (20B) is too slow to feature.

The mflux model is loaded lazily on the first ``generate`` call: the canonical
repos ship full-precision weights that mflux quantizes at load, so pulling them
at server boot would stall startup on a multi-gigabyte download.
