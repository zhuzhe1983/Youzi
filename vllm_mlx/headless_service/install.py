"""Validation + transactional install for the headless service.

``install`` is where most of the #2859 safety contract lives:

* least-privilege service account (must exist, uid>500, not root/admin);
* the install is transactional and, with ``--dry-run``, prints every
  mutation and performs none;
* a port-race guard refuses to install when a server already answers on
  the target port (the "cannot silently cohabit with a Desktop-managed
  server" criterion);
* secrets (``--api-key``) are refused — a system-domain daemon boots before
  login and must never carry a secret in argv or env;
* the model must already be cached under the service account's HOME (the
  documented workflow downloads once before the machine goes headless).

We shell out to ``launchctl``/``install`` rather than raising a Python
daemon, so the command surface stays exactly what the manual runbook
already documented — this command just makes it safe and one-shot.
