# FLUX.2 Klein explicit bf16 execution path

Issue [#3058](https://github.com/raullenchai/Rapid-MLX/issues/3058)
measured FLUX.2 Klein 4B at 1024×1024, four steps, with the same prompt and
seed on an otherwise-idle 32 GB M2 Pro Mac mini:

| Weight path | Wall time per image |
|---|---:|
| BFL bf16 | 44.0 / 47.4 s |
| BFL quantized on load to q4 | 52.5 / 52.0 s |
| Pre-quantized q4 alias | 51.5 / 52.7 s |

The mean q4-to-bf16 throughput gain is about 1.14×. The matching on-load and
pre-quantized q4 times isolate execution precision, rather than checkpoint
conversion, as the useful lever for this workload. These figures are supplied
measurements from the issue, not a new run performed by this change.

## Branch dogfood

The implementation branch was then dogfooded through the real `rapid-mlx serve`
and `/v1/images/generations` path on the same class of host:

- Mac mini, Apple M2 Pro, 32 GB unified memory, macOS 26.5.2;
- mflux 0.19.1, MLX 0.32.2, low-power mode off, no recorded thermal warning;
- otherwise-idle host, with its resident QSP service stopped for the A/B;
- identical prompt, seed 1001, 1024×1024 output, and four inference steps;
- two independent server processes per checkpoint, each with one discarded
  warm-up, followed by five measured requests combined across both processes.

| Weight path | Warm-up | Measured requests | Median | p95 (nearest rank) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Pinned pre-quantized q4 alias | 52.431 / 52.085 s | 54.643 / 60.425 / 51.882 / 52.463 / 52.703 s | 52.703 s | 60.425 s |
| Pinned packaged bf16 alias | 43.287 / 44.036 s | 46.065 / 41.820 / 40.538 / 42.805 / 40.844 s | 41.820 s | 46.065 s |

The packaged bf16 path reduced median end-to-end wall time by 20.6%, or 1.26×
throughput. Every repeat within a precision produced the same PNG SHA-256;
q4 and bf16 intentionally produced different bytes because the denoising
weights differ. Visual inspection found both outputs coherent and faithful to
the paper-crane prompt. A direct-engine companion run measured peak process RSS
at approximately 4.57 GB for q4 and 12.49 GB for bf16. Raw timing JSON remains
on the mini under `~/qsp-node/image_weight_dogfood_{exact_q4,exact_bf16}.json`.

The bf16 run used the exact pinned snapshot below. Before generation,
`mflux_missing_weights()` returned `[]`, proving all indexed component shards
were locally present. The QSP LaunchAgent was restored after the run and its
health endpoint passed.

Rapid-MLX therefore exposes an opt-in path while preserving existing behavior:

```bash
rapid-mlx serve flux2-klein-4b --image-weight-precision bf16
# Equivalent explicit alias:
rapid-mlx serve flux2-klein-4b-bf16
```

The bf16 alias uses the pinned, mflux-layout
`mflux-community/flux2-klein-4b-mflux-bf16` snapshot (15,975,684,703 bytes),
loads it through `model_path`, and passes `quantize=None`. The q4 alias and all
other models are unchanged. A range-read of the pinned snapshot's first
transformer shard found 69 tensors, all declared `BF16`, and no `.scales` or
`.biases` quantization auxiliaries. Automatic chip selection is deliberately
deferred until broader M1/M2 family coverage exists; the one measured M2 Pro
working set is not enough to define a safe hardware policy.

## Reproduction checklist

For a qualification run, record `sw_vers`, `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string`,
physical RAM, Rapid-MLX/mflux/MLX versions, power mode, and whether another model
is resident. Warm each path once, then run at least five timed images with an
identical prompt, seed, dimensions, and step count; report median and p95 plus
peak resident memory.

## Other diffusion lanes

DiffusionGemma is **discrete text diffusion**, not an mflux image model. Its
default canvas is 256 text tokens and each denoising step can likewise present
multi-row matrix multiplies, so the same q4-kernel crossover is a plausible
benchmark target. It is not covered by this switch: the curated checkpoint is
a 26B-total/4B-active MoE, uses mixed 4/8-bit weights, and a full bf16 copy would
exceed the 32 GB target where Klein bf16 fits.

A shape-level probe on the Studio (`Apple M3 Ultra`, macOS 26.5.2, MLX 0.32.2),
using DiffusionGemma's real dense projection shape `M×2816 @ 2816×4096`, group
size 64, five warm-ups and 20 individually synchronized samples, measured:

| Canvas rows | bf16 median | q8 median | q4 median |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 | 0.676 ms | 0.591 ms | 0.586 ms |
| 4096 | 6.475 ms | 6.260 ms | 6.183 ms |

On M3 Ultra, dequantizing that projection would therefore be a regression, not
an optimization. This microbenchmark does not cover the model's grouped MoE
expert kernels or prove the result on M1/M2. A useful follow-up is an
end-to-end 4-bit versus 8-bit and selective-dequantization profile on a
high-memory M1/M2 host; until that exists, changing DiffusionGemma's weight
precision would be an unmeasured compatibility and memory-policy change.

Reproduce the dense projection probe with:

```python
import statistics, time
import mlx.core as mx

def bench(fn, warmup=5, iterations=20):
    for _ in range(warmup):
        mx.eval(fn())
    samples = []
    for _ in range(iterations):
        started = time.perf_counter()
        mx.eval(fn())
        samples.append(time.perf_counter() - started)
    return statistics.median(samples)

for rows in (256, 4096):
    x = mx.random.normal((rows, 2816)).astype(mx.bfloat16)
    weight = mx.random.normal((4096, 2816)).astype(mx.bfloat16)
    mx.eval(x, weight)
    print(rows, "bf16", bench(lambda: x @ weight.T))
    for bits in (8, 4):
        packed, scales, biases = mx.quantize(weight, group_size=64, bits=bits)
        mx.eval(packed, scales, biases)
        print(
            rows,
            f"q{bits}",
            bench(
                lambda: mx.quantized_matmul(
                    x, packed, scales, biases, transpose=True,
                    group_size=64, bits=bits,
                )
            ),
        )
```
