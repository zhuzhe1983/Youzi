"""SOP §10 complement: no out-of-band routing escape hatches.

``tests/test_no_mllm_flag.py`` gates the CLI + ``load_model`` surface.
This file gates every OTHER surface where a contributor could sneak a
routing decision in:

  - Per-request: request body fields, headers, middleware
  - Runtime mutation: setter methods, post-init writes to routing
    attributes
  - Environment: ``os.environ.get("RAPID_MLX_FORCE_*")`` etc.
  - Engine API: ``engine.set_force_*`` / ``engine.set_*_mllm`` setters

Round-4 red-team found 13 bypasses across these surfaces (5 per-request,
5 env/config, 3 trust-attack). The SOP-§10 gate caught zero — the
attacks didn't touch CLI or load_model at all. This file is the
companion gate. The invariant: **routing fields are write-only inside
their constructor (``__init__``) or the canonical load path
(``load_model`` / ``detect_model_config`` / ``enrich_model_config``)
from kwargs that are themselves registered in
``AUTO_ROUTING_FLAG_PAIRS``**.

When this fails: either move the routing decision into the registry
(register a new ``RoutingFlagPair`` + plumb a CLI flag) or remove the
shortcut. There is no third option — the whole point of the registry
is that routing changes are visible and reviewable.

    SOP §10 gate by writing to ``engine._is_mllm`` / ``model_config.<routing
    field>`` from a request handler, middleware, sampling helper, admin
    endpoint, or env-var-driven branch — none of which the CLI/load_model
    gate watches.

    This test asserts the inverse invariant: routing fields are
    write-only inside constructors and the canonical load path. Any

    auto-degrade (#1187) can only be decided when mlx-vlm's strict weight
