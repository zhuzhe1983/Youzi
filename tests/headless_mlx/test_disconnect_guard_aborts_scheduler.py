"""C-01: ``_disconnect_guard`` must force-call ``scheduler.abort_request``
on client disconnect.

Astrid r3 (pydantic-ai + Qwen3.5-4B-MLX-4bit) ran
``agent.run_stream("Tell me a joke")``; the model failed to emit EOS
and ran past 6144 tokens. The httpx side raised
``RemoteProtocolError: peer closed connection`` after ~35s but the
server's ``_disconnect_guard`` polled 70+ times without intervening,
because Starlette's ``request.is_disconnected()`` never returned
True for this combination. Even when the disconnect signal DID fire
in other situations, the abort relied solely on the
``generator.aclose()`` cascade unwinding through
``stream_generate.finally`` to reach ``scheduler.abort_request`` —
which is fine for a graceful shutdown but doesn't bound how long
the upstream batch step keeps consuming GPU between the cancel and
the next yield boundary.

This module nails the C-01 contract: when a disconnect is detected
AND the engine has published its admitted ``request_id`` into the
``request_id_holder``, the guard MUST call
``engine.scheduler.abort_request(rid)`` synchronously. The cascade
remains as belt-and-suspenders but is no longer the primary signal.

    The disconnect_guard triggers force-abort from THREE places: the
    explicit disconnect branch, the ``except GeneratorExit`` block,
    AND the ``finally`` belt-and-suspenders. A test that only checks
    ``scheduler.aborts == [rid]`` would still pass if the
    ``except GeneratorExit`` block were deleted, because ``finally``
    would catch the case. Pre-codex-r2 the discrimination used
    ``f_lineno`` to count distinct source lines, which is brittle
    against harmless refactors.

    The behavioral distinction we pin instead: the ``except
    GeneratorExit`` branch fires BEFORE the ``finally`` clause's
    ``await generator.aclose()``. If we make the upstream generator's
    ``finally`` write to a shared flag, and patch
    ``_force_abort_request`` to snapshot that flag on each call, the
    SEQUENCE distinguishes the branches:

      * first abort call: upstream cascade has NOT run yet
        (flag still ``False``) — this is the except-GeneratorExit
        branch.
      * second abort call: upstream cascade HAS run (flag is
        ``True``) — this is the ``finally`` belt-and-suspenders
        firing after ``await generator.aclose()`` completed.

    Deleting the ``except GeneratorExit`` block collapses the
    sequence to a single call AFTER the cascade ran, which fails
    the test. No source-line coupling.

    Astrid r3 fingerprint: Starlette's StreamingResponse tears down
    via ``aclose()`` (GeneratorExit into our wrapper) when uvicorn
    detects a write failure to a dead socket — even though
    ``is_disconnected()`` returned False the entire time. Catching
    the branch here closes the second half of the runaway window.
