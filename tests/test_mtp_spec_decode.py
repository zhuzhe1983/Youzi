"""Unit tests for the vendored MTP speculative decode bundle (R15-P1 #302).

Coverage:

* Architecture detection (Qwen3.5 / 3.6 only; closed alias schema bypass)
* Accept-rate counter (record_attempt / record_accept / record_reject,
  snapshot consistency, ratio computation, reset semantics)
* ``ArraysCache.rollback_state`` slot patch (idempotent install, future-
  proof guard against upstream merging the same change)
* CLI flag parsing (``--spec-decode mtp|none``) + SchedulerConfig
  plumbing
* Metrics rendering (``rapid_mlx_spec_decode_*``)
* MTP head builder (constructs without weight load)
* Qwen3.5/3.6 model-side injection helper (uses a synthetic model
  shell so we don't have to load real Qwen3.5 weights)
* Generator loop verify/accept logic via a mocked model (chain MTP
  end-to-end without booting MLX-GPU)

The tests intentionally avoid loading a real Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6
checkpoint — those are 4-50 GB downloads and the lossless integration
test in ``tests/test_mtp_lossless.py`` exercises the loop with a
deterministic mocked model that lets us assert byte-identical output
without GPU contention (R15-P1 #302 explicitly defers the GPU bench
because Stage B Viterbi is currently holding the device).

def _reset_mtp_module_state():
    """Reset the MTP module-level singletons AND ``mlx_lm.generate``'s
    captured ``generation_stream`` between tests.

    Three pieces of cross-test state leak in the full pytest sweep and
    surface as the 7-failure transient cluster (PASS in isolation):

    * ``vllm_mlx.spec_decode.mtp.cache_patch._patched`` — sticky install
      gate; ``_unpatch_for_tests()`` clears it.
    * ``vllm_mlx.spec_decode.mtp.accept_counter._global_counter`` —
      monotonic counter singleton (monotonicity is a public contract);
      ``reset_global_counter_for_tests()`` is the explicit hatch.
    * **``mlx_lm.generate.generation_stream``** — the module-level
      ``generation_stream`` is created at import time via
      ``mx.new_thread_local_stream(...)`` (bound to the importer
      thread) and is then re-assigned by every call to
      ``engine_core._init_mlx_step_thread`` to ``mx.default_stream(
      mx.default_device())``. Crucially — and contrary to the name —
      ``mx.default_stream(device)`` returns the **current thread's**
      default stream, NOT a process-wide stream. So when a preceding
      sweep test (``test_batching_deterministic``, ``test_batching``,
      ``test_mllm_*``) spins up a ``mlx-step`` worker executor with
      ``initializer=_init_mlx_step_thread``, the worker's default
      stream gets stamped onto ``mlx_lm.generate.generation_stream``.
      When the worker shuts down and the pytest main thread later
      runs ``mtp_generate_step``, its ``with mx.stream(
      generation_stream): mx.eval(toks)`` block at
      ``generator.py:420`` crashes with ``RuntimeError: There is no
      Stream(gpu, N) in current thread.``

      The canonical fix is to re-bind ``generation_stream`` to **this
      thread's** default stream at fixture setup. This mirrors what
      ``_init_mlx_step_thread`` does for the executor worker, just
      pinned to the pytest main thread.

    (Prior fix attempted ``mx.set_default_stream(mx.new_stream(
    mx.default_device()))`` — that only resets the active default for
    the current thread, NOT ``mlx_lm.generate.generation_stream`` which
    is what ``mtp_generate_step`` actually uses. It also reintroduced
    ``mx.new_stream`` — a thread-bound allocator the production code
    deliberately avoids per
    ``tests/test_mllm_cross_thread_stream_contract.py``.)
