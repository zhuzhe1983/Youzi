"""MTP speculative-config wiring.

Coverage for the four surfaces PR-A ships:

1. ``detect_mtp_eligibility(..., has_external_sidecar=True)`` — Gemma 4
   unified base checkpoint (no baked-in MTP head) stays NONE even when
   the CLI has resolved a config ``model`` sidecar path. Qwen3.5 /
   Qwen3.6 eligibility is unaffected (their MTP head is baked into the
   target; a sidecar does not manufacture a missing head).

2. ``vllm_mlx.cli`` argparse — the legacy ``--mtp-sidecar`` flag is not
   exposed; MTP sidecars come from ``--speculative-config`` only.

3. ``SchedulerConfig.mtp_sidecar`` — round-trips as expected; default
   is ``None`` so pre-0.9.13 callers keep the old behaviour.

4. Engine dispatch call site — the batched engine's ``_start_llm``
   routes through ``dispatch_mtp_inject`` with the sidecar path when
   config MTP is set. Verified via a monkeypatched dispatch that
   captures the call args (no real model load).

Deliberately out of scope (deferred to PR-B / PR-C):

* Auto-K controller wiring
* Batched residual+bonus verify
* EOS holdout

    Prior revision appended the first token to ``gb.tokens[0]`` BEFORE

    then called ``_orig_step()`` which appends the SAME token again,

    Fix: construct the generator first, only mutate ``gb.tokens`` on

    mlx-lm reuses uid ints once a request completes. The round-D
    ``_disabled_uids`` fix keyed disable state by uid alone; that
    let a bad-sidecar disable from request N silently apply to
    request N+1, N+2, ... if they happened to draw the same uid,
    permanently disabling MTP after a single bad request.

    Fix: store the request_id at disable time. When the same uid
    shows up with a DIFFERENT request_id, the disable is stale —
    clear it and re-enter the normal MTP path.

    This test:
      1. Drives request A (uid=42, req-A) through a first-call
         construction failure — uid=42 lands in _disabled_uids.
      2. Simulates uid=42 being reused for request B (req-B) with
         a working generator constructor.
      3. Verifies that the wrapper does NOT stay in the disabled
         short-circuit — it re-enters the FIRST-call path and
         successfully seeds a fresh generator for request B.

    Earlier revision's ``_cleanup_uid`` unconditionally popped
    ``_disabled_uids[uid]``, which meant any fallthrough branch (B>1
    transition, non-greedy switch, logits-processors override) that
    called ``_cleanup_uid`` would silently un-disable a uid — the
    next single-uid greedy call would then retry MTP construction
    and hit the same broken path all over again, one construction
    attempt per token.

    Fix: ``_cleanup_uid`` no longer touches ``_disabled_uids``.
    The disable state is a per-REQUEST marker cleared only by
    (a) uid reuse detection with a new request_id, or (b) explicit
    delete in the reuse-gate branch. State (the generator + queue)
    is still cleaned by ``_cleanup_uid`` — that's per-generator
    lifecycle, not per-request.

    This test:
      1. Drives a first-call construction failure → uid=99 lands
         in ``_disabled_uids`` keyed by req-A.
      2. Triggers a B>1 fallthrough (which calls ``_cleanup_uid``
         for stale uids in ``_state``).
      3. Returns to B=1 single-uid and drives another step.
      4. Asserts that MTP construction is NOT retried — the

    mlx-lm reuses uid ints when a request completes and a new one
    joins the batch. Pre-round-K the wrapper's ``_state`` map was
    keyed on uid alone with NO request_id validation (unlike
    ``_disabled_uids`` which stores the owning request_id since
    round-E). Under uid reuse, the wrapper would resume the OLD
    request's generator on the NEW request's first _step call —
    a data corruption bug because the SUBSEQUENT branch pulls
    from the STALE generator (built for the old prompt +
    prompt_cache) and appends stale tokens to gb.tokens[0].

    Verify:
      1. Request A drives one FIRST-call emission and populates
         ``_state[uid=X]`` with request_id=req-A.
      2. Under uid reuse (uid=X → req-B without any
         ``_cleanup_uid``), the wrapper's uid-reuse gate MUST fire
         and treat the entry as stale: close the OLD generator,
         drop ``_state[uid=X]``, and re-enter the FIRST-call
         construction path for req-B.
      3. The new construction ATTEMPT happens (visible via ctor
         call count) — proving the reuse gate cleared the state
