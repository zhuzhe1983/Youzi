"""R11-B regression bundle — Bo's 0.8.12 audio dogfood follow-up.

Three findings:

* **R11-B-F2** — ``{"format":"mp3"}`` (the legacy OpenAI key) was
  silently dropped on ``/v1/audio/speech``; ``response_format``
  fell back to ``"wav"`` and the route returned HTTP 200 with
  ``Content-Type: audio/wav`` and RIFF/WAVE bytes. SDK clients
  copying older sample code (early ``openai-python`` < 1.0,
  Anthropic tutorials) had no way to tell their request was
  silently being downgraded. Fix: a ``model_validator(mode="before")``
  on :class:`vllm_mlx.api.models.AudioSpeechRequest` folds
  ``format`` into ``response_format`` when the latter isn't
  explicitly set. Explicit ``response_format`` always wins on
  conflict so a caller using both spellings (which itself is a
  client bug) never gets a silent override of intent.

* **R11-B-F3** — ``{"voice":"default"}`` (the obvious naive caller
  value) on kokoro / chatterbox / voxcpm was rejected by the
  voice-allowlist as ``invalid_voice``, even though the registry
  already advertises a ``default_voice`` for each entry — and the
  omitted-voice path (Pydantic default ``"af_heart"``) worked.
  The asymmetry was a UX trap. Fix: a
  :func:`vllm_mlx.routes.audio._resolve_default_voice_literal`
  pre-step maps ``voice="default"`` → ``entry.default_voice`` when
  the resolved model is registered.

* **R11-B-F4** — ``/v1/models`` for an audio-only alias advertised
  ``capabilities=["text"]`` and ``modality=null``. Drop-in OpenAI
  clients couldn't distinguish audio aliases from text models on
  the wire. Fix:
  :func:`vllm_mlx.routes.models._resolve_audio_entry` short-circuits
  audio aliases to ``capabilities=["audio.speech"]`` (TTS) or
  ``["audio.transcription"]`` (STT) and ``modality="audio"``.
