"""
Tests for EngineCore._run_on_step_thread / _mlx_executor.

Background: mlx-lm 0.31+ binds `mlx_lm.generate.generation_stream` to the
thread that creates it. Any MLX op that touches arrays tagged with that
stream from a different thread raises
``RuntimeError: There is no Stream(gpu, N) in current thread.``

The engine creates a single dedicated mlx-step worker thread so the
generation hot path stays on it. Anything else that touches KV-cache
arrays — most importantly the shutdown call to save the prefix cache —
must be routed through the same worker via _run_on_step_thread().

These tests exercise that machinery without spinning up a real model.
