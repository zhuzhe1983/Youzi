    Sets ``HF_HOME`` / ``HF_HUB_CACHE`` / ``TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`` and the
    machine-specific ``RAPID_MLX_*`` data dirs to a fresh per-test ``tmp_path``
    so no test accidentally reads (or writes) the host's real cache or state
    unless it deliberately opts in. This makes the no-MLX unit suite
    deterministic across machines: a box with a 400 GB ``~/.cache/huggingface``
    and a fresh Linux CI runner with none now run every non-opted-in test
    against the same empty cache.

    Network-off by default (#2518): an empty per-test cache turned every
    latent ``load_model`` / ``snapshot_download`` into a real download — on
    hosted CI that pulled ``Qwen3.5-9B-4bit`` once per leaking test and kept
    the no-MLX lane busy for ~20 min. So the same fixture also pins the
    Hugging Face hub offline (``HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`` plus the already-imported
    ``huggingface_hub.constants.HF_HUB_OFFLINE``) and fails any non-loopback
    ``socket.connect`` immediately with ``HermeticNetworkAccessError`` naming
    the test and the address. See ``_install_hf_offline`` /
    ``_install_network_guard``.

    Opt-ins (registered below, both must be reviewed):
      * ``@pytest.mark.real_hf_cache`` — use the host's real cache. A handful
        of integration tests legitimately probe it (scan the repo index for a
        real ``models--*`` layout, load real weights for a tokenizer/grammar
        file). It does NOT grant network access: a cached checkpoint loads
        fine offline, and an uncached one fails fast instead of downloading.
      * ``@pytest.mark.requires_network`` — disarm the network guard. Nothing
        in the unit suite needs it today; a test that genuinely does must
        say so here rather than depend on the runner's connectivity.
    Every OTHER test — including one that used to read the real cache
    (``test_doctor_env_health.py::test_huge_hf_cache_marks_warn``, made hermetic
    by mocking ``_hf_cache_dir`` / ``_dir_size_gb``) — is hermetic by default.

    Compatibility:
      * Tests that already manipulate these vars via ``monkeypatch`` in their
        own body simply override this fixture (test-body calls win; ``tmp_path``
        and the autouse fixture's values are torn down together). That includes
        ``HF_HUB_OFFLINE``: ``tests/test_cli_offline_serve.py`` sets it to
        ``"1"`` / ``""`` per test to drive the product's offline switch either
        way, and a test that mocks the downloader and wants the product's
        ONLINE path simply ``delenv``s it — the socket guard still stands.
      * The existing ``scheduler_config_stub`` fixture (NOT autouse) and the
        ``_reset_global_parser_state_after_each_test`` autouse fixture are
        unaffected — they never read HF / RAPID_MLX dirs.
      * Legacy ``HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE`` (pre-``HF_HUB_CACHE`` spelling) is left
        alone; no codebase reader uses it and ``test_release_check_random.py``
        toggles it itself.
      * Loopback / AF_UNIX sockets stay open: in-process test servers, uvicorn
        on ``127.0.0.1``, asyncio self-pipes and ``HF_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1``
        stubs all keep working.
