/// Per-tool consent gate for MCP connector tools.
///
/// Issue #1716 states the principle: an MCP server is an arbitrary local
/// process the model can invoke, so "should this model be allowed to call this
/// tool" is a **user** decision and belongs in a UI, not in a JSON file.
///
/// The shape is deliberately ``BrowseApprovalStore``'s — same `Mode`, same
/// `Decision` vocabulary (including the load-bearing `unavailable` vs `deny`
/// distinction), same continuation/cancellation dance. Two approval prompts
/// that behave subtly differently is a worse outcome than a little structural
/// repetition, and the browse store's cancellation handling was already
/// hard-won.
///
/// What's new here is that the grant is **remembered per tool**: "Always
/// allow" on `time__get_current_time` must not silently also grant
/// `shell__run`. `BrowseApprovalStore` can flip one global mode because it
/// gates one tool; this gates an open-ended set.
