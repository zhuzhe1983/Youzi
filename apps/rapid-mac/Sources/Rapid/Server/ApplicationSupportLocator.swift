/// Canonical resolution of ``~/Library/Application Support/Rapid``
/// that honours ``$HOME`` overrides.
///
/// ## Why this exists (#419 + #420)
///
/// Foundation offers two ways to find Application Support:
///
/// 1. ``FileManager.default.urls(for: .applicationSupportDirectory,
///    in: .userDomainMask)`` — internally calls
///    ``NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains`` which resolves through
///    ``getpwuid(geteuid())``. The result is the LOGGED-IN USER's
///    real home directory, ignoring any ``$HOME`` override the
///    process was launched with.
/// 2. ``$HOME + /Library/Application Support`` — honours the env
///    var by construction.
///
/// Production users never override ``$HOME``, so on real machines
/// the two resolve to the same path. Dogfood / test harnesses,
/// however, routinely override ``$HOME`` to isolate write paths
/// (e.g. launching the .app under ``HOME=/tmp/dogfood-v088/home``).
/// In v0.8.8 dogfood (#414), a slim-DMG test instance loaded the
/// user's real prod ``sessions.json`` because ``SessionStore`` used
/// shape (1) — the dogfood agent saw real chat content + the wrong
/// active alias, derailing the auto-spawn check. ``CrashReporter``
/// has the same bug, polluting the user's real
/// ``~/Library/Application Support/Rapid/crash-markers/`` with
/// dogfood-instance markers.
///
/// This locator is the single source of truth callers reach for.
/// Both pre-existing helpers
/// (``BootstrapCoordinator.defaultApplicationSupportRoot`` +
/// ``ServerLocator.defaultApplicationSupportURL``) delegate here so
/// a future refactor that wants to tweak the resolution rule has
/// exactly one place to change instead of N.
///
/// ## Resolution order
///
///   1. ``$HOME`` (if set and absolute) — appends
///      ``Library/Application Support/Rapid``. Honours dogfood
///      overrides + matches what shell `$HOME` expansion would do.
///   2. ``FileManager.default.urls(for: .applicationSupportDirectory,
///      in: .userDomainMask).first`` — defensive fallback for the
///      "no HOME set" pathology (sandboxed launch helpers, broken
///      env). Production never reaches this branch.
///   3. ``NSTemporaryDirectory`` last-resort — keeps callers
///      crash-free in the (effectively unreachable) double-fallback
///      case rather than forcing every caller to handle nil.
