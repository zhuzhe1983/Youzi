/// Owns ``rapid-mlx pull <alias>`` subprocesses that fetch HuggingFace
/// weights in the background **independently** of the live serve child.
///
/// v0.5.6 wired a single embedded ``rapid-mlx serve <alias>`` child via
/// ``ServerManager``. That child handles its own in-band download when
/// the alias isn't yet cached — but it does so as part of the SAME
/// process that wants to actually serve a model. While a 4-30 GB cold
/// download is in flight the user can't chat: the picker is bound to
/// the serving alias, clicking a different alias tears the serve down
/// and starts the new alias's download from scratch, and the chat
/// surface has no live backend in either direction.
///
/// v0.5.7 closes that hole by splitting download from serve:
///
///   * Clicking an UN-cached row in ``ModelPickerBar`` no longer
///     blocks the active serve — it spawns a side-car
///     ``rapid-mlx pull <alias>`` and registers the job with this
///     manager. The picker shows a spinner + tqdm-derived progress
///     next to the row until the job completes.
///   * The user keeps chatting with whatever ``ServerManager`` is
///     already serving. When the side-car completes, the row icon
///     flips to ``checkmark.circle.fill`` (because ``ModelCatalog``
///     re-walks and now sees the alias cached) and a single click
///     switches the active serve in the usual flow.
///   * Cancelling mid-download is SIGTERM → SIGKILL with a 2 s grace,
///     mirroring ``ServerManager.terminateChild``. HuggingFace's
///     resumable downloader leaves a partial snapshot under
///     ``~/.cache/huggingface`` so a later retry picks up where it
///     left off — the manager does not delete the partial cache.
///
/// Why a dedicated component (instead of folding into ServerManager):
///
///   1. ``ServerManager`` is single-tenant by design — it owns one
///      ``Process`` and one ``state`` enum. Adding a map of background
///      processes there would force every read of ``state`` to also
///      decide which child is being asked about.
///   2. ``DownloadManager`` is many-tenant by design — multiple
///      concurrent pulls are explicitly allowed (HF resolves their
///      file lists independently and writes to distinct cache dirs).
///      Co-locating it with the serve lifecycle would conflate the
///      two cardinalities.
///   3. Tests don't need a live binary — the manager exposes a
///      ``_testingInject`` hook so unit suites can drive every state
///      transition (started → progress → completed / failed /
///      cancelled) without spawning a real subprocess.
