///   1. General & Reasoning (`通识和推理`) — arithmetic mean of

///      one of the two is published, ``generalReasoning`` carries
///      that single number and ``generalReasoningSource`` records
///      which bench it came from so the tooltip footer can be
///      honest about the basis.
///   2. Code — LiveCodeBench v6 pass@1.
///   3. Tool — BFCL v3 composite (v4 numbers are treated as
///      comparable magnitude; per the audit's gap-honesty policy
///      the UI label stays version-agnostic).
///   4. Instruction Following — IFEval prompt-strict accuracy.
///   5. Speed — measured long-context decode tok/s; hardware is recorded in
///      the row's provenance (community rows use M3 Ultra, the release sweep
///      uses M2 Pro).
///
/// ``nil`` on any axis means neither a compatible published number nor a
/// recorded local release eval exists for that axis.
/// The UI must render the dashed track + em-dash value in that row.
