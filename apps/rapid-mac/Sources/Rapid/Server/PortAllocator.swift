/// Picks a free TCP port for ``rapid-mlx serve`` to bind on. The
/// historical desktop assumed :8000 was always available and crashed
/// the spawn when a user's vite / jupyter / fastapi held it (the
/// ownership-verified ``PortSweep`` correctly REFUSES to kill those
/// foreign processes, which is why "just run lsof + kill" isn't a
/// fix). v0.5.6 walks a 10-port window so a foreign collision causes
/// the child to land on :8001 / :8002 / … instead of dying.
///
/// Algorithm — for each candidate ``8000 … 8009``:
///   1. Run ``PortSweep.sweep(port:)`` so a rapid-owned orphan from a
///      previous run gets reaped first (cross-version
///      compatibility — rapid-mlx pre-0.7.3 doesn't always SIGTERM
///      cleanly on parent Force-Quit).
///   2. Open a ``SOCK_STREAM`` socket, ``setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR``
///      so lingering TIME_WAIT sockets from the previous bind don't
///      block us, then ``bind`` to ``127.0.0.1:<candidate>``.
///   3. First bind that returns success wins — close the probe
///      socket and return the port.
///
/// A bind-probe is preferred over checking ``lsof`` because it sees
/// every socket state the kernel knows about (LISTEN, TIME_WAIT,
/// CLOSE_WAIT) and surfaces kernel-level restrictions like reserved
/// ranges. ``lsof`` is fast but only sees processes the caller can
/// inspect.
///
/// Returns ``nil`` when every candidate is held by a non-rapid
/// process — the caller (``ServerManager.start``) surfaces a banner
/// and stops, giving the user an actionable error rather than a
/// silent "exited with status 1".
