/// rapid-desktop's source lives in a **private** GitHub repo, but
/// release artifacts (DMG + manifest) are published to a public R2
/// bucket fronted by `dl.rapidmlx.com`. The app used to poll that
/// static JSON object directly; as of the update-ping migration it
/// polls a thin Cloudflare Worker on the landing-page domain that
/// returns the **byte-identical manifest** but also counts the poll
/// as an aggregate active-install signal — no proxy of GitHub, no
/// PAT, no GH API rate-limit:
///
///   GET https://github.com/zhuzhe1983/Youzi/releases/latest/download/latest.json?v=<app-version>
///
/// If that Worker fetch fails for any reason (down, non-2xx, or a
/// manifest that fails decode/validation) the check falls back to the
/// same GitHub latest.json asset without the `?v=` query, so a
/// Worker outage never stops updates — only the active-install count
/// is missed for that poll. See ``fetchWithFallback``.

/// appcast and verifies the EdDSA signature over the payload it
/// downloads, so integrity lives there, not here.
/// Codable silently drops unknown keys, so existing manifests don't
/// need a schema bump when those fields appear/disappear.
///
/// `sidecar_*` / `model_*` are bootstrapper-only fields read by
/// ``BootstrapCoordinator`` on first-install (slice γ + slice δ).
/// The in-app UpdateChecker does NOT take action on them. Declaring
/// them here as `Codable Optional` so a future migration (e.g.
/// surfacing "sidecar fix-up download" in Settings, or driving the
/// in-app installer through the bootstrapper machinery) only has
/// to wire UI, not re-touch the Codable type. ALSO: tightens the
/// already-tolerated unknown-field behaviour into an explicit
/// schema record so a publisher-side typo (e.g. `model_alais`)
/// trips a `keyNotFound` in tests rather than silently shipping
/// nil to production. Schema_version stays at 1 — the new fields
/// are additive optional (Codable default-nil on absence), no
/// publisher coordination required to roll them out.
///
/// Decisions:
///
///   * Per-launch only, no timer. Sparkle owns the recurring
///     "is there a newer version" schedule; a second timer beside it was
///     pure duplication. Mac users restart apps weekly+, so per-launch was
///     the dominant cadence anyway.
///   * No background fetch via NSURLSession schedulers.
///   * No auth header — the endpoint is public.
///   * **Privacy contract.** The ONLY thing this request sends is
///     the app's own version, as the `?v=` query parameter (plus the
///     standard `User-Agent`). No device fingerprint, no unique ID,
///     no usage data, nothing about the machine. The Worker records
///     only aggregate counts — version and (Cloudflare-derived)
///     country — and never stores the client IP. The check is a
///     plain fail-open GET: any network or decode error silently
///     leaves the app on its current version (no alert, no crash),
///     and it is skipped entirely when the user has opted out (see
///     ``updateChecksEnabled``).
///   * Installation is Sparkle's job entirely. This type never downloads,
///     verifies or swaps a bundle; it reports what the manifest says so the
///     version pill and the Settings panel have something to render.
