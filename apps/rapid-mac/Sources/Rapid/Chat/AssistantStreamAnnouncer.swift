/// Pure, side-effect-free core that decides *what* (if anything) to
/// speak to VoiceOver as an assistant reply streams in.
///
/// Issue #478: streaming replies are not a VoiceOver live region, so a
/// blind user activates Send and then gets no signal that the model
/// started, is streaming, or finished. macOS SwiftUI has no
/// ``accessibilityLiveRegion`` equivalent, so the fix is a throttled
/// stream of AppKit announcements. This type owns the *decision* half;
/// it is deliberately free of AppKit / SwiftUI so the throttling and
/// chunking logic is unit-testable in isolation. The AppKit posting
/// lives in ``VoiceOverAnnouncer`` and the wiring in ``ChatViewModel``.
///
/// Contract:
///   * ``firstTokenCue`` fires once, on the empty -> non-empty flip, so
///     the user learns the model began responding.
///   * ``onDelta`` emits ONLY the trailing un-announced sentence(s),
///     and only when a sentence terminator (``.`` ``!`` ``?`` or a
///     ``\n\n`` paragraph break) has landed past ``announcedOffset``
///     AND ``minInterval`` has elapsed since the last announcement.
///     This throttles per-token spam. VoiceOver already has the full
///     body navigable, so we never re-read the whole buffer — only the
///     new tail. Scanning starts at ``announcedOffset`` so the cost is
///     O(new text), never O(buffer).
///   * ``onTerminal`` fires exactly once with a short terminal cue
///     ("Response complete" / "Response stopped" / the error string) —
///     never the reply body.
