/// at 200+ tok/s) burned a hop per emitted delta. This coalescer
/// accumulates ``content`` and ``reasoning_content`` deltas inside
/// a coalescing window and emits ONE MainActor callback per window
/// — collapsing a 500-token stream from ~500 hops to ~30.
///
/// The window starts at 16 ms (one display frame at 60 Hz) and, past
/// ``adaptiveThresholdChars``, widens in proportion to the text already
/// flushed, up to ``maxWindowNs``. A fixed window would leave the turn
/// quadratic: each repaint re-parses the whole message, so an O(length)
/// parse at a fixed rate costs O(length²) over the turn (#1743).
///
/// Held as a reference type so the captured mutable state survives
/// the ``await`` boundary the SSE loop crosses on every line
/// without tripping Swift 6 strict-concurrency captures.
///
/// Contract (codex r1 hardened):
///   * ``appendContent`` / ``appendReasoning`` push text into a
///     SINGLE ordered queue keyed by kind, merging into the
///     trailing entry when the kind matches. The first call of
///     each kind surfaces IMMEDIATELY (first-token visibility —
///     the typing indicator must not wait a frame). Subsequent
///     calls flush once the current window (see
///     ``currentWindowNs()``) has elapsed.
///   * ``flush`` emits the pending queue IN ORDER, so a
///     content→reasoning interleave preserves the server's wire
///     order — there is no cross-kind reordering.
///   * Callers MUST invoke ``flush`` before any non-delta event
///     (usage, tool_calls, finish_reason, [DONE]) AND before
///     throwing on cancellation or transport error. The send()
///     scope guarantees the latter via a `defer` block.
///   * The window is opportunistic (checked on each append), not
///     timed, and its length is adaptive — 16 ms until the message
///     passes ``adaptiveThresholdChars``, then proportional to the
///     text so far up to ``maxWindowNs`` (#1743): if a delta burst stops mid-window,
///     the trailing text is held until the next event of any
///     kind or until send()'s defer flush. Real backends emit
///     a continuous stream of deltas terminated by

///     flush in send()'s catch path still drains the tail.
