/// A 3×18pt amber bar in the leading gutter, a neutral fill, and a

/// difference small enough to miss.
///
/// It replaces the v1.0 pairing of an amber TINT fill plus a deep-amber
/// label, which failed for a reason worth recording: the tint
/// (``brandPrimaryTint``) and the rail it sat on
/// (``surfaceSidebar``) were within a few percent of each other, so on
/// the rail — the one place selection matters most — the fill was
/// effectively invisible, and the whole signal came down to a hue shift
/// in a 13pt label. That is the single least robust way to encode state:
/// it is the first thing lost to colour-blindness, to a dim display, and
/// to peripheral vision.
///
/// The bar is a hard-edged shape, so it survives Increase Contrast and
/// reads at a glance from across the desk; the semibold weight carries
/// the row even in a screenshot with no colour at all. Amber is spent
/// here rather than on the fill because the rail's whole budget is one
/// small brand moment, and a bar is a smaller, sharper one than a slab.
