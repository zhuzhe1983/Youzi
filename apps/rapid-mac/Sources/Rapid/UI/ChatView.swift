/// assistant transcript. Calibrated against the model's typical
/// long-form output: a paragraph or two of prose, an H3 section
/// header, a numbered list of bolded items, occasional inline code.
///
/// The big wins over Apple's ``AttributedString(markdown:)``:
///   * Headings get real font-size jumps and top/bottom margins
///     instead of rendering as plain body text.
///   * Lists use a hanging indent so wrapped lines align under the
///     first character of the item, not under the bullet/number.
///   * Code blocks get a distinct background, padding, and a
///     monospaced font.
///   * Paragraph spacing is honoured — multi-paragraph answers no
///     longer collapse into a wall of text.
