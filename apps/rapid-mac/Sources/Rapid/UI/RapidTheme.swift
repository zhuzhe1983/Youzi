    // The single source of truth for "Rapid blue." Before this token

    // whatever accent the user picked in macOS System Settings — so
    // the product could render pink, graphite, or orange and never
    // reliably showed the Rapid-MLX identity. This is a *softer
    // azure* than the indigo wordmark on the GitHub banner: calmer in
    // a large light UI, friendlier, and still unmistakably "Rapid."
    //
    // Applied app-wide via ``.tint(RapidTheme.brand)`` at the scene
    // root (so every button / link / selection inherits it) AND used
    // directly wherever a literal ``Color.accentColor`` used to paint
    // a brand surface (the empty-state disc, capability glyphs, the
    // compose focus ring). The dark variant lifts toward a brighter
    // sky-blue so the accent keeps its punch against a dark canvas.

    // the ChatGPT / Linear / Apple-desktop feel the refresh targets.

    // now the website's muted *steel blue* (`--accent` #3A5C86), NOT
    // the old saturated blue-violet and NOT macOS system blue. Paired
    // with a warm amber-gold (the cheetah hue) defined below.
