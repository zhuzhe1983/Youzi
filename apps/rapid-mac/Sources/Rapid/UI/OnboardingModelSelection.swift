/// The one selection + progression contract shared by every Step 2 list
/// (Paper 05.2.G — "CTA derivation contract" and "Activation truth table").
///
/// ## Why this is a separate, pure enum
///
/// Step 2 now has three surfaces that can offer the same model — the
/// recommended shortlist, in-window Browse all models, and Review download.
/// Before this existed the chooser derived its footer inline:
///
/// ```swift
/// primaryTitle: canStartWithoutDownload(...) ? "Start existing model" : "Download & start"
/// ```
///
/// That is a two-way branch over one input, and it was correct only because
/// there was exactly one list and every row in it was always visible. Neither
/// holds any more: a catalogue row can be filtered out, searched away, absent
/// while the catalogue loads, missing because the catalogue failed, or too big
/// for this Mac. Duplicating the branch onto two more surfaces would give three
/// sites deciding what the button says, and the interesting cases are precisely
/// the ones a duplicated ternary gets wrong.
///
/// So the derivation lives here, once, as a pure function over the *visible*
/// rows. Paper states the rule as `selection ∩ visible rows in the active
/// list`: stored intent alone is never enough, because a selection the user
/// cannot see is not something they can be said to be choosing.
///
/// ## What it deliberately does NOT do
///
/// It never clears the selection. A pick hidden by a filter or a search is
/// "memory, not intent" — the alias is retained and becomes actionable again
/// the moment it is visible, which is what makes clearing a search restore the
/// previous pick without anything re-picking it. Only *actionability* changes.
///
/// Nothing here reads a label, a badge, a section heading or a card style.
/// Cached-ness arrives as a `Bool` derived from the catalogue snapshot
/// (``QuickstartView/canStartWithoutDownload(alias:cachedModels:)``), and
/// availability from ``ModelSizing/classify(_:on:)`` — the same decision the
/// model picker already disables on. Presentation is never evidence.
