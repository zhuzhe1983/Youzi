    ///
    /// It was one, and that was the defect. `.sheet` on macOS is a
    /// document-modal panel: AppKit sizes it to its content's ideal width,
    /// insets it, rounds its corners and leaves the parent window visible
    /// around and behind it. So onboarding rendered as a centred card floating
    /// over a dimmed chat surface — the exact composition 05.1.A rules out
    /// ("no dimmed application, no modal card floating over a live app, no
    /// composer, no production sidebar and no status strip behind it"). Worse,
    /// the sheet settled at its 620pt minimum, which is below the 820pt
    /// breakpoint, so the rail collapsed to its compact strip on a 1440pt
    /// display and the full-height rail was effectively unreachable.
    ///
    /// Replacing the shell instead of covering it makes the geometry correct
    /// by construction: this view IS the window's content, so it fills
    /// everything below the native title bar, has no corner radius of its own,
    /// and there is nothing behind it to show through. The title bar and its
    /// traffic lights are untouched — "full window" here means the app's
    /// content area, never macOS fullscreen.
    ///
    /// Nothing about the state machine moves with it. ``quickstartVisible`` is
    /// the same predicate that gated the sheet, and every alert, dialog and
    /// task modifier stays attached to the root above this branch, so approval
    /// dialogs and launch auto-start behave exactly as before.
