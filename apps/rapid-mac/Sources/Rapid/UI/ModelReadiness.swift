/// The single authoritative answer to two questions the app was
/// previously answering in four different places, inconsistently:
///
///   1. Can the user send a message right now?
///   2. If not — what is happening, and what should they do about it?
///
/// ## Why this type exists
///
/// Before this, readiness was re-derived per surface and the surfaces
/// disagreed. ``ChatView`` decided the empty-state subtitle from
/// ``ServerState`` alone; the composer's Send button consulted only
/// whether the draft was non-empty; ``ConnectToolsView`` rendered *two*
/// readiness sentences at once with two different verbs ("start a chat"
/// in the header, "Start a model" in the body); and the model picker
/// showed a cache glyph that said nothing about whether anything was
/// running. A user could see "Choose a model", a bright enabled Send
/// button, and — on pressing it — a transcript row reading
/// "Couldn't start ." with an empty model name.
///
/// ``ModelReadiness`` collapses all of that into one value derived once
/// per render from one set of inputs. Every surface that talks about
/// readiness reads its copy off this type, so they cannot drift.
///
/// ## The lifecycle it models
///
///     choose  →  download (if needed)  →  start  →  ready  →  send
///
/// The cases below are exactly the user-visible steps of that sequence,
/// plus the two ways out of it (``failed``, ``engineMissing``). Note
/// that ``needsDownload`` and ``needsStart`` are distinct: "chosen but
/// not on disk" and "on disk but not running" are different situations
/// with different costs (minutes vs seconds) and different copy, and
/// conflating them is most of why users could not tell choosing from
/// downloading from starting.
///
/// ## Sending is gated on ``ready``
///
/// ``sendAllowed`` is true only in ``ready``. This replaces the previous
/// implicit contract where pressing Send on a cold model silently
/// triggered a multi-gigabyte download behind an indeterminate spinner.
/// The trade is deliberate: one extra click (the banner's Start action)
/// buys the user a visible, cancellable, explicable startup. The draft
/// is never consumed by a gated send — see ``ChatView.send``.
///
/// Pure and free of SwiftUI so the whole truth table is unit-testable
/// without standing up a view host or a live subprocess.
