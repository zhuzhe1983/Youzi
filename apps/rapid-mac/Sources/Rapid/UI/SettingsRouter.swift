/// Deep-link channel into the Settings window.
///
/// This app has **no SwiftUI `Settings` scene**. It declares a real
/// ``Window("Settings", id: "settings")`` (see ``RapidApp``) so the
/// menu-bar tray item can open it, and ⌘, is re-wired to the same
/// window. The consequence every call site has to respect:
/// ``@Environment(\.openSettings)`` — `OpenSettingsAction` — targets a
/// scene that does not exist here and is a **silent no-op**. The only
/// working path is ``@Environment(\.openWindow)`` with
/// `openWindow(id: "settings")`.
///
/// `openWindow` also takes no category, so it can only say "open
/// Settings," not "open Settings on the Tools panel." Users
/// (2026-06-10) called this out: clicking the bottom-bar status pill
/// landed them on the default tab and they had to hunt for the item
/// they came for.
///
/// ``SettingsRouter`` is a tiny ``@Observable`` shared via the SwiftUI
/// environment that closes that gap. A call site sets
/// ``requestedCategory`` to the desired tab and then calls
/// `openWindow(id: "settings")`; ``SettingsView`` observes the field
/// via ``.onAppear`` (covers the "first open this session" case) and
/// ``.onChange`` (covers the "already-open Settings gets re-focused"
/// case), applies the request, and clears it back to nil so a
/// subsequent open without a request lands on the user's last
/// selected tab.
///
/// **Order is load-bearing**: assign ``requestedCategory`` BEFORE
/// opening the window. `SettingsView` reads it from `.onAppear`, so an
/// assignment made afterwards races that read and drops the user on
/// the last-used tab.
///
/// Why an ``@Observable`` instead of a stored property on
/// ``SettingsView``: SettingsView's ``@State`` lifetime is tied to
/// the Settings scene, which can be created/destroyed independently
/// of the main window. A router living on ``RapidApp`` survives both
/// and lets ``ContentView`` (or any other surface) hand off a target
/// before the Settings scene even exists.
