/// supporting copy, an optional hint, and optional secondary actions.
///
/// Sizing is deliberately restrained. The pre-v1.0 chat empty state
/// used a 60pt disc with a 27pt glyph pinned 96pt from the top of the
/// transcript, which pushed the whole composition off-centre and made
/// a 640pt-tall window feel like a mostly-empty poster. Here the disc
/// is 44pt, the block is vertically centred by its container, and the
/// content column is width-capped so it stays a considered object
/// rather than stretching with the window.
///
/// The mark is generic over its content rather than type-erased through
/// ``AnyView``: the empty state's brand moment is a real bundled image
/// (``YouziLogo``) on the chat surface but a plain SF Symbol
/// elsewhere, and both should stay statically typed so SwiftUI can
/// diff them properly.
///
/// Actions are ``rapidSecondaryCompact`` by contract: an empty state
/// offers side-doors, and none of them should out-shout the real
/// primary action on the surface (in chat, the composer).
