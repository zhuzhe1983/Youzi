/// The grouped-section primitives every Settings panel is built from.
///
/// ## Why these exist
///
/// Before this, four panels each carried a private copy of the same two
/// helpers — `SettingsView.settingsCard`/`sectionHeader`,
/// `SettingsToolsPanel.card`/`header`,
/// `SettingsConnectorsPanel.card`/`header`, plus six inline repetitions
/// of the same `RoundedRectangle` recipe in
/// `SettingsModelManagementPanel`. Four copies meant four radii to keep
/// in sync, four heading sizes, and four sets of padding, and they had
/// already drifted: cards were 12pt while the rest of the app was 8pt,
/// headings ranged over `.title2` / `.title3` / `.callout`, and two
/// panels drew no card at all.
///
/// These types are the single owner of that treatment. A panel now says
/// what a group IS; it does not describe how a group looks.
///
/// ## The rules they encode
///
/// * One card per section, and **never a card inside a card** — content
///   handed to ``SettingsSection`` draws no background of its own.
/// * Section headings live OUTSIDE the card, so the card holds controls
///   and only controls.
/// * Rows are separated by ``SettingsRowDivider``, inset to the content's
///   leading edge so the divider starts where the text does.
