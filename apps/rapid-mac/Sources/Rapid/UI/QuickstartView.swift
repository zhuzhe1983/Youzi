/// First-launch single-button onboarding for brand-new users who have
/// no model on disk yet.
///
/// ## Why this surface exists
///
/// Production DMG ships with ``BUNDLE_MODEL=0`` (see ``scripts/build.sh``)
/// so the .app envelope contains zero model weights — the v0.7.1
/// bundled-snapshot path in ``BundledModel`` only fires for airgapped
/// builds. A brand-new user launches Rapid-MLX Desktop, lands on the
/// chat surface, and has nothing to chat with: the picker is a haystack,
/// every entry triggers a 1-80 GB cold download, the chat composer is
/// inert until something finishes loading. That is the worst possible
/// first-touch shape for an inference app.
///
/// Quickstart collapses the cold-start into one guided choice. The card surfaces
/// when (a) the user has no last-served alias persisted — or has one that
/// is a ``retiredStarters`` entry, i.e. a model we stranded them on —
/// AND (b) the quickstart flag in UserDefaults hasn't been set yet AND
/// (c) the server isn't already busy with something else. The chooser picks a
/// hardware-fit starter, preferring an eligible cached chat model, and uses the
/// existing ``DownloadManager`` only when the chosen model is not on disk. It
/// then auto-spawns that selection and
/// drops the user into chat with a single seeded assistant message
/// introducing the model.
///
/// ## Starter policy
///
/// Below 16 GB, onboarding starts from LFM2.5 1.2B; at 16 GB and above,
/// it starts from Qwen 3.5 4B. An eligible cached chat model takes priority
/// so an existing installation does not force another download. LFM2.5 2.6B
/// remains available as a more capable step-up for a lower-memory Mac, while
/// 1.2B remains the explicit low-memory alternative on larger Macs. The policy
/// is pure and covered by the starter matrix tests.
///
/// ### What this means for the empty state
///
///   1. Capability affordances continue to come from catalog metadata; the
///      starter choice does not invent capability claims.
///   2. The ``ChatView`` empty-state prompts stay model-agnostic pure
///      text by design — they must read well on ANY starter, not tease
///      a capability tied to one alias — so they are unchanged.
///   3. Users who want more depth trade up via the picker's
///      **Recommended Default** (``RAMBucketedDefault``), and the
///      ``UpgradeBanner`` nudges them there after a few turns.
///
/// ### What we keep
///
///   * A short install + chat path for the brand-new user.
///   * A dedicated "Quickstart" picker section after onboarding.
///
/// The alias resolves in ``vllm_mlx/aliases.json`` (rapid-mlx submodule)
/// so the value is pinned, not derived. Bumping it is a deliberate
/// product decision — change the constant + re-run the model
/// recommendation tests. Air-gapped bundled builds keep their independently
/// versioned small fallback; production DMGs do not bundle model weights.
///
/// ## Why a separate surface (not folded into ``ModelPickerBar``)
///
/// The picker is the long-tail browse-and-trade-up affordance. It
/// presents tens of aliases, makes the user reason about size/quant/
/// context, and is exactly the friction we want to spare first-touch
/// users. Quickstart is a parallel surface that replaces ONLY the
/// chat-area frame — the picker bar above stays visible so a user who
/// reads "or browse all models →" has the picker already in sight. The
/// card never returns once the user successfully Quickstarts or
/// manually picks something else from the picker (eligibility falls).
///
/// ## Why ``@Observable`` + a coordinator (not pure-view state)
///
/// The state machine outlives the view: a Quickstart download in
/// flight should survive a SwiftUI re-mount (e.g. main window
/// briefly hidden), and the persisted flag must be writable from
/// outside SwiftUI (tests, future Settings → "Reset onboarding"
/// affordance). Lifting the state into an ``@Observable`` coordinator
/// makes both shapes natural.

/// One selectable model in the Quickstart wizard's "choose your first
/// model" step (#1524). The wizard defaults to — and recommends — the
/// hardware-fit starter (see ``QuickstartCoordinator.defaultChoice(hardware:catalog:)``), but lets
/// the user trade up to a bigger model before the first download.
///
/// ``hfRepo`` is pinned for authored starters (it wires the precise
/// bytes-on-disk monitor for the first-impression cold install — see the
/// ``kickoffDownload`` rationale). The bigger options pass ``nil`` and
/// fall back to tqdm file-count progress; both drive an identical
/// download → serve → seed pipeline.
