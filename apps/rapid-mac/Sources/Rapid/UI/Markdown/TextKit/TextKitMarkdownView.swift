/// The chat transcript's markdown surface, rendered through TextKit 2.
///
/// Replaces the MarkdownUI-backed `LaTeXMarkdownView` for settled messages
/// (#1843). Streaming messages render through
/// ``StreamingTextKitMarkdownView`` — an incremental, frame-presented document
/// feeding the same block stack — so both paths are TextKit 2 now.
///
/// ## What carries over unchanged
///
/// * **Link safety** (#304/#349). `.chatLinkSafetyFilter()` is applied at the
///   same level as before: the outer container, so every block inherits the
///   allowlist through the environment. The filter works by replacing
///   `\.openURL`, which is scheme-based and does not care whether the link
///   came from `Text` or from an `NSTextView` — see the verification test.
/// * **Table accessibility** (#1824). `AccessibleMarkdownTable` needs only a
///   `TableModel`, so it is fed directly from the compiled `TableBlock`
///   instead of re-serialising the block back to markdown and re-parsing it
///   with a hand-written splitter. Same AX output, one less round trip, and
///   the 8-column cap is no longer a parse-time rejection — a 9-column table
///   still renders visually, it just has no AX representation, exactly as
///   before.
/// * **Display math** (#131). Routed to Rapid's own `MathView`; inline math
///   stays folded into prose as literal `$…$`, which is what
///   `displayMathOnly` already did.
/// * **Dynamic Type** (#546). The base point size arrives from the caller as
///   a resolved `CGFloat` — see `ChatView`'s `@ScaledMetric`. TextKit needs a
///   number, not a SwiftUI font, so the scaling happens once at the boundary
///   rather than being re-derived per block.
struct TextKitMarkdownView: View, Equatable {
    let content: String

    /// Body point size, scaled for Dynamic Type (#546).
    ///
    /// MarkdownUI does this itself — its `ScaledFontSizeModifier` wraps the
    /// theme's root `FontSize` in the one and only `@ScaledMetric`, which is
    /// why `.rapidChat` sets a fixed literal and the theme comment warns
    /// against adding a second one at the call site.
    ///
    /// TextKit has no such pass: `NSFont` takes a number. So the scaling lives
    /// here, once, inside the view — not at the call site, which would be the
    /// double-scale bug that comment is about (~15 × scale²). 15 is the same
    /// literal the theme uses, and the two must move together; the theme
    /// comment names three literals that already travel in lockstep, and this
    /// is now a fourth.
