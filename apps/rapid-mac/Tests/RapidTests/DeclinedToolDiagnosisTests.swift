/// "The user said no" is not a malfunction.
///
/// The regression these lock down: a declined `browse` approval used to fall
/// through to ``FailureDiagnosis/Kind/toolFailed``, so clicking **Don't allow**
/// painted a red tool card reading *"The tool couldn't finish. Check its input,
/// then try again."* — the app reporting a fault, blaming the user's own input
/// for it, and offering to retry the very thing they had just refused.
///
/// Four properties are pinned here, and all four matter:
///   1. A decline classifies as ``FailureDiagnosis/Kind/userDeclined`` and
///      reads as an ordinary outcome (``FailureDiagnosis/Severity/notice``,
///      no action button).
///   2. The classification rides an explicit marker from the approval gate —
///      never a guess at the wording of an English sentence.
///   3. Only an actual "no" counts. A cancelled turn, or a prompt that could
///      not be shown, is NOT the user's decision and must not be attributed
///      to them.
///   4. A GENUINE browse failure still classifies as a failure. A fix that
///      quietly reclassified real errors as user choices would hide them.
