        // no longer compiled and a fresh suite would land with v1.0.
        //
        // Measuring that claim rather than inheriting it changed the answer.
        // Two things were conflated:
        //
        //   1. The FIRST compile error was a missing test-only dependency
        //      (ViewInspector, used by 9 files). "No such module" aborts the
        //      build before type-checking, so it masked everything behind it
        //      and made the damage look total. Adding it back was a dead end:
        //      7 of the 9 referenced stripped subsystems anyway, and the
        //      surviving 2 deadlocked EVERY @MainActor test on a headless CI
        //      runner (1,413 started, 0 finished, 45 minutes). SwiftUI view
        //      introspection wants a GUI session; the runner has none. Those
        //      2 files are deleted and the dependency is gone — do not
        //      reintroduce it without a headless-verified alternative.
        //   2. Behind it, 137 of 254 files genuinely did not compile against
        //      the stripped Sources. Those are deleted. The remaining 117
        //      compile and run: 1,485 tests, green.
        //
        // The cost of the exclusion was not hypothetical. The suite pinned
        // `BundledModel.bundledAlias`, `QuickstartCoordinator.defaultChoice`,
        // `storageKey`, and `AutoStartDecision.SkipReason`'s case set — every
        // value the retired-starter swap touched. Dormant, it caught none of
        // them, and a starter model that degenerates on an ordinary chat
        // question shipped for months.
        //
        // `import Testing` resolves fine on Swift 6.1; the toolchain note
        // that said otherwise predates it.
        //
        // Deleting a test is a real decision. If one fails, read it first —
        // several of these were correct about code that had moved, and two
        // were reporting live defects: a $HOME-bypassing Application Support
        // lookup in ConversationStore, and an 8-15 GB tier pick with no
        // benchmark row. Both are fixed here rather than deleted.
