# stage-licenses.sh — stage third-party Swift license texts into a bundle so the
# notices travel with the binary (#1596).
#
# The shipped .app (and DMG) is the "distribution" that swift-cmark's
# BSD-2-Clause and the linked MIT packages ask their notice to accompany;
# assembling only the repo's THIRD_PARTY.md does not satisfy that. This script
# stages the notices into <out-dir> (build.sh points that at
# Contents/Resources/Licenses/).
#
# It is a standalone script — not an inline block — so the test suite can drive
# it against fixtures and assert both the success staging and the fail-closed
# behavior deterministically, without depending on a resolved checkout cache.
#
# Usage:
#   stage-licenses.sh <package-resolved> <checkouts-dir> <vendor-swiftmath-license> <out-dir>
#
# Fails (non-zero) when a linked package has no license file, when a resolved
# pin has no checkout, when no remote pins parse, or when the vendored notice is
# missing — a package must never ship without its notice.
