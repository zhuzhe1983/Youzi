# Phase B made the first-run wizard's "RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR N GB MAC" row
# derive from the host's REAL physical RAM. A single committed golden
# baseline therefore can't be host-independent: a 14 GB CI runner lands on
# the 8 GB tier (lfm2.5-2.6B) while a 256 GB release Mac lands on 48+
# (qwen3.8-27B + qwen3.6-35B). The golden gate runs in BOTH places (CI and
# the operator's release Mac), so every persona that renders the chooser
# pins the same tier to keep its AX baseline deterministic.
# 8 = the 8 GB tier, which is exactly what the committed compact-chooser
# baseline captures (safe fast pick lfm2.5-1B as the starter; smart
# lfm2.5-2.6B as the optional memory-guarded capability upgrade). Pinning 8 also happens to
# be the safe tier for cached-curated-tradeup: its assertion needs
# qwen3.5-4b to stay a native curated trade-up, which 8 GB guarantees
# (16/24/32 GB hosts fold qwen3.5-4b into the recommended row instead).

Usage: gui-golden-flows.sh [--flow NAME] [--keep] [--update-baselines]

Flows: fresh-install, cached-quickstart, cached-curated-tradeup, cached-variant-collapse, download-progress, settings-persistence, settings-mtp, chat-restore, chat-depth, launch-integrations,
       model-crash-recovery, low-memory-choice,
       update-state, update-busy, campaign-banner, window-close-prompt, no-dead-controls, catalog-integrity,
       browse-all-destination, chat-document-attachment, chat-multimodal-attachments, image-generation, dictation, dictation-rc2-upgrade, audio-readiness, all

Most named regression flows drive the app through the accessibility API alone.
The preflight contract tests keep the exact allowlist in sync with
flow_requires_peekaboo below. Those flows need neither Peekaboo nor Screen
Recording, which lets them run unattended in CI (see the gui-golden-flows job
in .github/workflows/rapid-mac-ci.yml).

Options:
  --update-baselines  rewrite the committed AX structural baselines instead of
                      comparing against them. Intended UI changes land as a
                      reviewable diff under Tests/GUIGoldenFlows/__Snapshots__.

Environment:
  RAPID_GUI_SOURCE_APP   built .app to test
  RAPID_GUI_GOLDEN_OUT  artifact directory
  RAPID_GUI_BASELINE_DIR AX structural baseline directory
  PEEKABOO_BRIDGE_SOCKET Peekaboo bridge socket

# description check adds "no stream in flight". Without this the crash-recovery
# tree was captured mid-restart on roughly half of all runs: the button already
# reads "Send message" while the sidecar is still loading, and the transient
# "Starting …" banner then appeared in one run's baseline and not the next.
#
# Readiness is the ABSENCE of AXHelp, and there is deliberately no positive
# attribute to test instead: the button is `enabled=false` in every settled
# state, because a drained composer has nothing to send. So "not ready" and
# "ready with an empty box" differ only by the hint.
#
# That makes a *failed* AX read indistinguishable from readiness — rapid-ax
# omits an attribute it could not read. Mitigated by requiring the element's
# other attributes to have been read successfully in the same pass
# (`has("description")`, `has("enabled")`): an isolated failure of the help
# read alone, with its siblings intact, is the only remaining hole, and it has
# to happen twice in a row because the state must also be STABLE across two
# consecutive dumps. The dump walks the readiness banner before the send
# button, so a single dump can be a hybrid of two states.
