#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/walkthrough.sh — drive the F1-F10 release walkthrough via
# AppleScript AXIdentifier lookups. Built to replace the cliclick-by-
# coordinate flow that lost contact with SwiftUI gesture recognizers
# (typing + keyboard shortcuts work via cliclick; mouse clicks land at
# the right pixel but don't trigger button onClick handlers).
#
# Prereq: the running build must be from a tree that wires the
# matching `.accessibilityIdentifier(...)` modifiers on each control.
# `feat/walkthrough-a11y-identifiers` is the seed PR that introduced
# the three identifiers used below; subsequent walkthrough additions
# extend the list incrementally.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/walkthrough.sh                  # quit + relaunch + run
#   scripts/walkthrough.sh --no-relaunch    # assume app already up
#
# Screencaps land under /tmp/rapid-walkthrough-<UTC>/.
