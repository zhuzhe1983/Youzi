"""Structural AX baselines for the Youzi desktop golden flows.

``rapid-ax dump`` serialises the whole accessibility tree of the running app.
The golden flows already collect those dumps; this tool turns one into a
*stable* structural fingerprint that can be committed and diffed, so a change
that silently drops a button, reparents a control, flips an enabled state or
renames an identifier shows up as a reviewable diff instead of passing
unnoticed.

Scope, stated plainly: this is structure only. It cannot see colour, spacing,
typography, ordering *within* a text run, or anything else that does not reach
the accessibility layer. The PNG snapshots under
``Tests/RapidTests/__Snapshots__`` remain the pixel-level check.

What the normalizer keeps
  * nesting depth and parent/child relationships (rendered as indentation)
  * ``AXRole`` and ``AXSubrole``
  * ``accessibilityIdentifier``
  * ``AXDescription`` / ``AXHelp``, and ``AXTitle`` only when the element
    publishes no ``AXDescription`` (scrubbed, see below)
  * ``AXEnabled``
  * the *kind* of ``AXValue`` — ``bool:true`` / ``bool:false`` for toggles,
    ``number`` / ``text`` / ``empty`` for everything else
  * sibling order below the window level

What it drops or rewrites, and why
  * ``bounds`` — absolute screen coordinates move whenever the window opens at
    a different origin; two consecutive launches produced 715,107 and 725,145.
    Layout size is equally volatile across displays.
  * ``pid`` — new every launch.
  * top-level window order — AX returns windows in z-order, so opening
    Settings reorders the roots. Windows are sorted by identifier/title.
  * value *contents* — a token/s figure, an on-disk size, a model name or a
    streamed transcript is data, not structure.
  * version strings, byte sizes, token rates, durations, dates, clock times,
    UUIDs and ``/Users/<name>`` paths inside titles/descriptions/identifiers.
    ``Settings.App.UpToDate`` legitimately carries the release version, and a
    conversation row identifier legitimately carries a fresh UUID.
  * caller-supplied tokens (``--scrub``) — the golden flows pass the fake
    model alias so a rename of the fixture is not a baseline change.
  * ``AXTitle`` on an element that also publishes ``AXDescription`` — the
    description is the label the app authored, the title is AppKit's own
    synthesis from how the control is drawn, and that synthesis differs
    between macOS releases (see ``render_node``). A baseline that pins it
    cannot be regenerated on one macOS and used on another, in either
    direction.
  * ``AXSelected`` — dumped by ``rapid-ax.swift`` (a flow has to be able to ask
    which model card the user chose, see #1653) but deliberately NOT rendered
    here. Which of several equal-looking cards is highlighted is state, not
    structure, and it legitimately differs between a fresh persona and a
    relaunched one. Flows assert it against the raw dump instead.

    same identifier and description, with the tooltip surfacing as ``AXHelp`` on
    the child. macOS 26 publishes the button flat, with no inner copy. Keeping
    the outer button (so a vanished control is still a diff) and dropping the
