# build.sh — produce a launchable "Rapid-MLX Desktop.app" from the SPM executable.
#
# Naming (see issue #164): the .app bundle on disk is
# ``Rapid-MLX Desktop.app`` for fresh installs. Existing 0.5.21 installs
# auto-update in place — the updater replaces the running bundle at its
# existing path, so a user with ``/Applications/Rapid.app``
# keeps that path forever (or until they manually re-install from the
# DMG). The display name everywhere (Dock, About, menus) reads
# "Rapid-MLX Desktop" via CFBundleDisplayName.
#
# SwiftUI executables built by `swift build` are bare Mach-O binaries; macOS
# needs them wrapped in a versioned bundle (Contents/MacOS + Info.plist +
# Resources) before LaunchServices will treat them as an app. We assemble
# that bundle manually and codesign it so Gatekeeper recognises a
# well-formed signature (the previous Tauri build hit the "damaged" trap
# whenever the seal was incomplete — see archive/tauri-v0.1).
#
# Signing is env-driven: ad-hoc by default (local dev, no Apple account
# needed), or a real Developer ID identity when CODESIGN_IDENTITY is set
# (CI release path — adds hardened runtime + secure timestamp, which
# Apple notarisation requires). See scripts/notarize.sh + the release
# GitHub Actions workflow.

# v0.5.10: SHIP-BLOCKER fix. v0.5.9 attempted to satisfy
# ``Bundle.module`` by copying SPM's ``Rapid_Rapid.bundle`` into
# ``Contents/Resources/``. That looked plausible but doesn't work:
# SPM's auto-generated ``resource_bundle_accessor.swift`` for
# executable targets only probes
# ``Bundle.main.bundleURL/Rapid_Rapid.bundle`` (i.e. the .app's
# TOP level, sibling to ``Contents/``) — not anywhere inside
# ``Contents/``. On miss it ``fatalError``s inside
# ``dispatch_once``, which crashed the v0.5.9 DMG on first
# render of the product logo. Putting the bundle at the .app
# top-level satisfies the accessor but trips
# ``codesign --deep --strict`` (the SPM-emitted directory has
# no ``Info.plist`` and Apple's .app structure expects nothing
# at the top besides ``Contents/``).
#
# The correct fix:
#   * ``YouziLogo`` does not use ``Bundle.module``; it uses
#     ``Bundle.main.url(forResource:)``.
#   * We copy the PNG into ``Contents/Resources/`` as a flat
#     files, so ``Bundle.main`` resolves them the way macOS
#     resource lookup expects.
# Source-of-truth for the assets stays under
# ``Sources/Rapid/Resources/`` so SPM keeps them on the test
# target's ``Bundle.module`` (used by the snapshot suite via
# the ``BundleFinder`` walk in ``YouziLogo``).

# v0.6.6: embed rapid-mlx sidecar (issue #171). MONOREPO: the sidecar is
# built from the rapid-mlx engine that lives at the repository ROOT (two
# levels up from apps/rapid-mac). There is NO git submodule here — the
# engine checked out at this commit IS the version contract, reviewable
# in the same PR diff. (The desktop repo built the sidecar from a
# ``third_party/rapid-mlx`` submodule; build-sidecar.sh now points
# RAPID_MLX_SOURCE at the engine root instead — see ENGINE_ROOT below.)
#
# Why staging happens BEFORE codesign below: the outer codesign step
# seals every file under Contents/ into CodeResources. The sidecar's
# 77 Mach-Os are individually signed inside build-sidecar.sh; the
# outer (non-deep) codesign then hashes their bytes into the resource
# envelope so any post-build tampering invalidates the seal.
#
# SKIP_SIDECAR=1 short-circuits the 5-10 min pip install for local
# iteration. The resulting .app has no bundled rapid-mlx, so
# ServerLocator falls through to .userInstalled / .path / brew slots
# — fine for dev, not for shipping.
#
# Normal local builds retain the last complete sidecar stage and reuse it when
# the rapid-mlx commit and all packaging inputs are unchanged. Set
# FORCE_SIDECAR_REBUILD=1 to refresh floating Python dependencies explicitly.
# Developer ID release builds always rebuild and verify from scratch.
#
# scripts/build-sidecar.sh lives alongside this script; the packaging
# logic is the app's concern. In the desktop repo the pip-install source
# was a third_party/rapid-mlx submodule — MONOREPO removes that
# indirection: the pip-install source is the engine at the repo root.
# MONOREPO: the engine source is the repository root, two levels up from
# apps/rapid-mac (this script lives at apps/rapid-mac/scripts/). Override
# RAPID_MLX_ENGINE_ROOT to point the sidecar build at a different engine
# checkout. build-sidecar.sh independently defaults RAPID_MLX_SOURCE to
# the same location; we compute it here too so the preflight check and
# the cache-key/version derivation below agree with what the sidecar
# build will actually pip-install.
